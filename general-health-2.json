    "Title": "Colonoscopies Are Critical to Preventing Colon Cancer",
    "Content": "Colorectal cancer is a preventable disease that is still the third-leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that of participants who received a colonoscopy, the procedure decreased the risk of developing colorectal cancer by 31% and lowered the risk of dying from colorectal cancer by 50%.\n\nThe bottom line: Colonoscopies save lives!\n<h2>Understanding Prevention Versus Screening</h2>\nMost cancers cannot be prevented. Physicians can detect them only after they have reached a certain size and can be visible, whether through a physical exam or in computed tomography, magnetic resonance and others. Screenings are usually meant to identify individuals who already have cancer.\n\nColorectal cancer is among the few cancers that can actually be prevented in most cases. Colorectal cancer starts as a polyp. Polyps are small lumps or moles that grow inside the large intestine or rectum. When small, they are considered precancerous, but as they grow, they can become cancerous and spread to other organs. Treatment in these scenarios may include major surgeries, chemotherapy and radiation therapy, among others. As cancer progresses, the risk of dying from colorectal cancer increases.\n\nWhen a polyp is found during a colonoscopy, the physician can remove it and have it tested for cancer. If found and removed early, during the precancerous stage, that patient may have just avoided developing colorectal cancer altogether. That means colonoscopies are useful not just as a screening tool for cancer, but also to help prevent it. The success rate of a colonoscopy finding a polyp, when present, is approximately 95%.\n\nFecal occult tests (stool tests), even the new highly advertised DNA-based ones, are great screening tests (they will find cancer, if present, in most cases), but they miss detecting polyps approximately 50% of the time or higher. These polyps then have the potential to develop into cancer.\n\nWhen it comes to cancer, any test is better than no test! However, tests that increase prevention should be preferred over those that just detect cancer. Would you buy a car with an engine that fails to run 50% of the time? Probably not. When your life is on the line, don’t settle for less. Colonoscopies are the only test that can detect and remove precancerous polyps before they turn into colorectal cancer.\n<h2>A Symptomless Cancer</h2>\nIt may take a polyp five to 10 years to develop into cancer. Most patients experience no symptoms. By the time patients develop symptoms,  precancerous polyps may have already progressed to cancer. Further, the cancer may already be in a later stage, making it harder to treat.\n\nPrevention or even screening should be important to all of us, especially as there are numerous tests available. Higher-risk individuals, such as those with a family history of colon polyps or cancer, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, and/or an inherited syndrome, are at increased risk. Being overweight, having a diet high in red meats and processed foods, using alcohol or smoking also increase a person’s risk.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that people with an average risk begin regular screenings at age 45. We should all learn to advocate for ourselves, it is our life at risk – ask your doctor questions about screening and prevention.\n<h2>Stopping an Epidemic</h2>\nColorectal cancer has dramatically increased in individuals between age 40 and 50, to the point that some news outlets are calling this an epidemic. On the contrary, colorectal cancer in the U.S. is decreasing in those 50 years old and older. This is thanks to the extensive screening programs in place and significant efforts from medical societies to educate our population and physicians.\n\nIt cannot be emphasized enough that colonoscopies save lives. If you’re eligible for a screening colonoscopy, talk with your physician about colorectal cancer prevention. In many cases, insurances cover 100% of the cost of a screening colonoscopy. Talk with your family or friends who tell you they are opting for an easier stool test. Share your knowledge about the importance of colonoscopies; you may be saving a life.",

    "Title": "Why Men Should Care About Their Care",
    "Content": "A friend and I sat for coffee at a picnic table in a Costco store. It was the only place with seating near where we planned to meet. Her husband completed a few rounds of physical therapy after surgery for a broken femur bone. She’d been caring for him for several years, following colon cancer, a diagnosis of hydrocephalus and now his broken bone. Given her worries about his periodic lack of initiative, I asked, “Can he get up and make a sandwich for lunch?” She responded, “Yes.” Then I responded, “Tell him to make two. One for him, one for you.”\n\nMy friend was raised in an era when women were responsible for not only the house but for keeping their man happy and alive.\n\nTimes change. Despite the designation of “caregiver” for the one spouse who is healthy, men are now researching more about their medical needs, buying the groceries recommended by the dietitian and taking charge of their own care. My mother had to remind her husband to get a haircut. Years later, my husband knows to practice yoga when, after being on his feet all day as a physician, his spinal alignment is not in balance.\n\nMen are also taking on the <em>weight</em> of that care, the mental burden of thinking about their bodies, their health and lunch—tasks that had fallen on women’s shoulders for too long.\n<h2>Addressing Health Care</h2>\nMaking appointments and showing up for tests are easy. Men easily ace those types of exams unless, of course, a serious, more complex issue is discovered. It’s the ongoing nature of upkeep, maintenance and doing the little things for their care where men often stumble.\n\nOnce men have completed health care tasks, where things are done for them or to them such as a needle prick or taking blood pressure, next comes caring for their health, which implies taking a proactive role – like changing the oil, taking the initiative to start a new diet, or lead the meal planning efforts in the household or for themselves. My son and my two sons-in-law are responsible for most of their family’s grocery shopping. My father was occasionally sent out on grocery runs, but most of the trips were made by my mother with kids in tow to carry the bags. I work from home and the grocery task often falls to me on my lunch hour. However, my husband occasionally offers to make dinner with whatever I had planned, including leftovers.\n<h2>Finding Independence in the Role</h2>\nThere are plenty of reasons for my friend’s husband to make his own sandwich. First, the chore keeps him off the couch and away from the television. Second, it frees my friend’s time and offers her husband independence and control, a healthy approach to strengthen their marriage. And third, given his preferences, he might create a better sandwich for himself.\n\nThe more women can let go of roles, however difficult due to the axiom of “I’ll do it myself,” the greater the opportunity for men to take on the mental load of thinking about their care. It’s also important for women to set an example without enforcing it. Psychologist Alan Dienstag says when individuals are around others who are doing an activity, this serves as a powerful enticement to do it themselves. I’ve been on a 30-day yoga journey since the beginning of January. In a recent conversation, my husband slid in the fact he had participated in the video series too. My friend gave her husband his own calendar to set his appointments. Now, it’s a job for him.\n<h2>How else can men approach caregiving?</h2>\n<em><a href=\"https://www.rwjf.org/en/insights/blog/2021/04/normalizing-men-as-caregivers-helps-families-and-society.html\">Normalizing Men as Caregivers Helps Families and Society</a></em>, a paper by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, proposes men need to take on caring for themselves, offering benefits for them when they are more involved as caregivers to others around them. Their primary findings demonstrate men are changed when they are in the caregiving role of children or families, and stereotypes that include the <em>incompetent</em> <em>male</em> need to be eliminated, as decades of research have proved this is no longer true.\n\nThat same research is quoted, “Fair divisions of work and care mean women are less stressed and can be more present for their children and/or loved ones with disabilities. Children in turn benefit from having equal fun, academic, and personal time with dad – which also benefits them developmentally.” We can eliminate the self-perpetuating, “Can you make me a sandwich?” in generations to come.\n\n<strong>Annette Januzzi Wick</strong> is a writer, speaker, and author of <em>I’ll Have Some of Yours, </em>a journey of cookies and caregiving.<em> (Three Arch Press)</em>.

    "Title": "Unaddressed Trauma and Disease",
    "Content": "In the book, <em>The Myth of Normal</em>, Gabor Maté, physician and author, encourages ordinary people to become more informed about the link between the body, the nervous system, the endocrinological systems and the psychology of the mind. The stresses we experience, the traumas we inherit or incur and other environmental factors, can lead to diseases and disorders. Over time, our bodies struggle to heal when these factors are not addressed.\n\nWhile it might be difficult to determine now, I often wondered if my mother’s dementia and my father’s Parkinson’s were brought on or exacerbated by extraordinary circumstances within their household when they were 78 years old. As my parents aged, they did not slow down. The household stressors of raising their young granddaughter for a time led to more challenges than they were willing to admit.\n\nIn one of his first articles as a medical columnist for <em>The Globe and Mail</em> in<em> </em>1993, Maté wrote, “When we have been prevented from learning how to say no, our bodies may end up saying it for us.” He believes the body’s way of saying “no,” or in most cases, “no more,” is transformed into a disease.\n\nWhat is it our bodies most want to tell us when we are cold, aching or chilled? Are we lonely, do we need a walk? Have we been caring too much for others, or do we simply need to slow down? Or is the past coming back to us in pieces we need to explore and open to the light?\n<h2>How Trauma Affects the Body</h2>\nThe physician is quick to define trauma and how we talk about it. First, injury is what happens to us, and trauma (the stress of it) is what happens inside of us, how we carry it within our bodies or how we respond. Second, there are widespread traumas, such as surviving a concentration camp, and there are singular, more personal traumas, such as a child dying at birth.\n\nIf not faced, the pain from these traumas leads to repressive tendencies to “move on” from the tragedy in our lives. We’ve seen this with concentration camp and war survivors, with those who have endured abuse, with immigrants who have left the homeland, with anyone who has ever heard the phrase “get over it.”\n\nWe get over it. Our bodies do not.\n\nMost of Maté’s book weaves pertinent research with anecdotes about systemic diseases like Parkinson’s and multiple sclerosis (MS). He notes how our strategies to “self-cope” without seeking help, without disclosing the truth we’ve experienced no matter how big or small, leads to inflammation in our bodies causing disease to take hold.\n<h2>How Stress Impacts DNA</h2>\nAccording to Maté, we might seek our answers to what he terms <em>psychoneuroendocrinology</em>, or <em>the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body, </em>from sources like telomeres.\n\nWhat are telomeres? Telomeres are minute structures of DNA at the end of our chromosomes. In his book, Maté likens telomeres to the plastic aglets placed at the end of shoelaces to keep them from fraying. According to <a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/02/150206125342.htm\">a 2015 publication in Sciencedaily.com</a>, “Cell division happens throughout life, telomeres get shorter and shorter as we age. When the telomeres run out, the cell becomes inactive or dies, which leads to disease.” If we can track the length and stability of these telomeres, we can learn more about our health and our aging.\n\nIn discussing telomeres in <em>The Myth of Normal</em>, Dr. Elissa Epel, Ph.D, a Professor and Vice Chair in the Department of Psychiatry, at the University of California, San Francisco, shares, “We started with about 10,000 when we were a baby and get down to 4,000 when we die.” When cells divide, telomeres shrink too. “And thus, immune function is impacted, and we fall more susceptible to illnesses,” Epel explains.\n\nFor instance, twins carry similar genes, but one twin might have a longer life expectancy than the other due to divorce, children or other stressors in their lives. “The stress shortens their telomeres. Similar results have been seen in caregivers of people living with dementia,” Epel shares.\n\nThe above refers to a <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1531903100\">study published in 2003</a>, with 119 men and women caregivers of a spouse living with dementia and 106 non-caregivers with a mean age of 70 entering into the research. Levels of health attributes and proinflammatory cytokine (IL-6) were measured across six years. The levels of IL-6 rose four times higher for the caregivers than for those without loved ones to focus on. The study demonstrated that long-time stressors detract from healthy aging as easily as acute injuries do.\n<h2>Finding Healing</h2>\nThe chronic stressors caregivers incur not only impact the caregiver but others around them. In Maté’s book, a Native American tells of a practice of keeping angry people away from a pregnant woman so the child in the womb does not absorb the negative energy. Creating safe practices to relieve your stress and processing your own trauma away from your duties of caregiving through therapy or body movement, such as yoga, will go a long way toward cementing a healthy relationship between a caregiver and a loved one.\n\nIf we better understand stress and its impacts, and if communities provide more education about, and in support of, the discoveries of our traumas big and small, we will find healing. We might have to give up working out to recover from injury, slow down in our lives to face our truths or even change relationships in order to confront the conflicts and move forward in our life.\n\n<strong>Annette Januzzi Wick</strong> is a writer, speaker, and author of <em>I’ll Have Some of Yours, </em>a journey of cookies and caregiving.<em> (Three Arch Press)</em>.

    "Title": "2 Simple Habits To Promote Healthy Aging",
    "Content": "Whether you’re 18 or 81, developing routines to promote healthy aging now can benefit you in the long run. Begin your journey to better health and well-being by incorporating these two daily habits into your routine.\n<h2>Move More</h2>\nWith a busy schedule, finding time to exercise often falls to the bottom of the to-do list. However, participating in daily movement is an important aspect of healthy aging. Especially since between the ages of 30 and 60 most people lose about 15% of their baseline muscle mass.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults participate in 150 minutes of activity that gets their heart beating faster each week. Activities could include anything from going on a bike ride to shooting hoops or taking a brisk walk. Start small if you don’t think you can find the time. Partaking in just 12 minutes of an activity a day can make a huge difference to your overall health and well-being.\n\nExercising every day will help you live longer and maintain good health during your lifespan. Don’t be intimidated by a lofty expectation – set an achievable daily goal and stick with it.\n<h2>Sleep More</h2>\nSleeping more sounds easy in theory, but as we grow older and responsibilities increase, getting the recommended seven to eight hours of sleep each night becomes increasingly difficult. It’s important to remember that without an adequate amount of sleep, our bodies will not be able to get the tasks at hand done efficiently and effectively. Sometimes the best thing you can do is lay the work to rest until tomorrow and go to bed.\n\nSleep is like a reset for your body. While sleeping, your blood pressure and heart rate decrease, blood sugar is regulated and stress diminishes. This helps your body fuel up and prepare for the day to come.\n\nIf you’re successful in making it to bed on time but are having trouble falling asleep, don’t sweat it. Even resting in bed has its benefits. However, if you are consistently having trouble sleeping, there could be underlying health issues or stressors in your life. Talk to your primary care provider so they can help get you back to sleeping easy.\n\nBoth movement and rest have their place in a healthy lifestyle. The key is finding the balance between the two and implementing both in your daily life.",

    "Content": "Taking care of your feet is important all year long and is vital to our overall health and well-being. During the winter season, our feet can be prone to dryness, injury and poor circulation. Take a step towards bettering your foot health this winter with these tips for winter foot health.\n<h2>Choose the correct shoes.</h2>\nBoots are a must-have footwear in our snowy Ohio climate. Many popular winter boots and shoes sacrifice function for fashion. When choosing shoes this winter, try to find something that provides support and is waterproof or water-resistant. Arch support helps to distribute pressure evenly across the foot, which can improve posture, absorb shock and reduce or prevent pain. Look for a deep tread pattern too, which can help to prevent slips and falls while navigating the wet and icy winter ground. Without proper footwear, it may be difficult to navigate slippery, wet or icy areas, which could result in significant injury.\n<h2>Keep your feet warm, but not too warm.</h2>\nIn cold weather environments, the body has mechanisms to retain heat in our core, but sacrifices warmth and circulation to the extremities, like our feet. Try pairing your winter shoes with a pair of thick cotton socks to help with the thermal regulation of the feet and toes. This can help to keep your feet warmer for longer periods of time. Warmers are a great way to add external heat to your feet but please be sure they are not in direct contact with the skin as this could cause a burn. Many people will use space heaters or fireplaces during the cold winter months. Please do not place your feet directly in front of a heater or fireplace as this can also cause a burn, especially if you fall asleep! If you have nerve damage or neuropathy to your feet, this is especially important.\n<h2>Listen to your feet.</h2>\nDuring the winter months, there is often less humidity in the air which can lead to dry, cracked skin. If your feet are feeling dry, make sure to use lotion on your feet as needed to keep them well moisturized. If your feet or toes are cold and begin to feel painful, please take a break from the cold weather to allow your extremities to warm up. Listen to your body in this regard. Cold exposure symptoms such as pain and redness could cause significant tissue damage even within an hour.",

    "Title": "How To Capitalize on Stress",
    "Content": "Stress – not exactly something that anyone desires to be feeling. However, when stress does enter your life, there is a way of approaching it that brings about the best possible outcome. Try to flip the narrative to turn your bad stress into good stress.\n<h2>So, what is good stress?</h2>\nThink of good stress as the nervous-excited feeling that you get before performing on stage, presenting a new idea at work, or going on a first date. Whereas bad stress is the nervous-anxious feeling that causes irritability, overthinking and uncomfortable physical symptoms such as a headache or stomachache.\n<h2>Mindset Matters</h2>\nNo matter what the stressful situation is, your mindset matters. “Your mindset determines how stress affects your body and your brain,” shares Jackie Van Zile, MA, LPCC, LCDC-III, a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\">ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</a>. “If you’re expecting something to be bad, the odds that it will be bad are pretty high. Whereas if you’re expecting something to go well, it’s much more likely to go well.”\n\nThe way you perceive stress is directly related to how it impacts you. Try to maintain a positive mindset when experiencing stress – it is better to tell yourself that the stressful event will go well rather than convince yourself that it will go poorly.\n\n“Your mindset can change the narrative. If you have a job interview coming up and approach it with a hopeful, confident mindset, you’re more likely to get the job. If you approach it with a fearful, anxious or self-defeated mindset, then you’re less likely to get the job because it shows,” Van Zile shares.\n<h2>What does bad stress look like?</h2>\nBad stress may manifest itself differently for everyone. Common signs that you have turned the corner to nervous-anxious (bad) stress can include mood swings, headaches, stomachaches, sleeplessness, increased worry, and decreased ability to focus.\n\nThe best way to combat bad stress is to pay attention to your stressors and do something to address the thing that is stressing you out. Try to flip your mindset to be more positive about the stressor, take some time to do something that you love, or talk it out with a family member or friend.\n\n“Do your best to stay in the nervous-excitement phase (good stress) rather than letting yourself get to the nervous-anxious phase (bad stress),” Van Zile shares.\n\nStress is normal and everyone experiences it. Stress can just be stress, it doesn’t have to be a bad or negative experience if you’re able to grab ahold of it and turn it into something positive or constructive.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jacquelyn-van-zile-ma-lpcc-cdca-counseling-and-therapy\"><em>Jacquelyn Van Zile,  MA, LPCC, LCDC-III</em></a><em>, is a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\"><em>ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</em></a><em> and has worked in the mental health field for the past 8 years.

    "Title": "The Link Between Sports and Cognitive Functioning",
    "Content": "Over the holidays, our household was filled with a rookie collegiate baseball player, a former NCAA soccer player and several passionate national football league (NFL) fans. A recent spate of concussions for a Miami Dolphins quarterback sparked conversation amongst these sports fans about the impact sports have on our brains.\n\nWhen my son was younger, his good friend was struck in the head by a baseball while standing on the pitcher’s mound. Countless surgeries, therapy appointments and days of worried parents later, the young man now holds a job in construction. His father advocated for changes in the proliferation of aluminum bats in youth baseball leagues while his son worked to overcome speech and physical deficits, evident now only to those closest to him.\n\nHe returned to the mound in a lesser role, unable to fully leave the game he loved. While a focus on sports continues to play a larger role in our society, researchers are learning more about how and why we need to protect our youth and professional players from long-term injuries.\n<h2>Head Trauma in Youth Football</h2>\nRenowned former Cincinnati Bengals player, Anthony Munoz, made it clear to his son that he would not be allowed to play football until high school. There were ample flag football leagues at his disposal until then. The former All-American wanted to ensure his son’s brain and body had developed enough to sustain the impacts which awaited in contact sports. He was right.\n\nIn an <a href=\"https://secure-web.cisco.com/18v51AnNEeZLYgZTFDoutTNFgHtwz6rgZV55T-AkvD4SaEMsIfn7DidfaxWBkAo1JjVWB54dszQbsAwlVw-rolpazCS1r5l7HS0EETUCHAJOShnra2TfCcGMAxWpBx4Mqojk5TS3ypV89ZxFvcCnYu4dNC2IxtdyvTYE0_AO8hvvtCOl3wPylAqbmT7afm4e26Dnz6lkgkqrTmoQG9bBSXkktcivw2nBKkzViS7ukcNpBfzlzvAYwmJ4jgWnMRcz3sLS5G7XOzMJutI4d0x3VzKSF_-b_X0-e5j8sC_KSywybRD5s7vE78Vzfadr-YdJdcVLd6QlJVPqJPOqwAfsdyQ/https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1177%2F03635465211011754\">American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine study</a> published in 2021, researchers collected head impact data from 524 tackle and flag youth football athletes over the course of a football season. Their ages ranged from 6-14 years old.\n\nBased on a measurement of gravitation force equivalents, they discovered that youth tackle football participants had 18 times more head impacts per practice, and 19 more head impacts per game, than flag football participants. They also determined that youth tackle football athletes experienced twice as many forceful head impacts during games than they did during practices (13 head impacts versus seven, respectively).\n<h2>CTE in the NFL</h2>\nNo mention of brain health and sports would be complete without referencing one of the most significant studies undertaken looking at professional football players and the incidences of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://memory.ucsf.edu/dementia/chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy\">University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)</a>, “CTE is a condition that may result from head injuries, especially in athletes of contact sports like boxing or football. The condition slowly damages parts of the brain and may cause trouble with memory, other thinking skills, behavior, personality, speech or balance.”\n\nOn May 3, 2012, Junior Seau, a star linebacker with the San Diego Chargers for 20 seasons, shot himself in the chest and died.\n\nDr. Ann McKee, the founder of the largest bank of brain studies for people exposed to traumatic brain injury, examined over 300 brains of deceased NFL players, including at least 24 who died in their 20s and 30s. She stated it is safe to presume Junior was dealing with CTE over his final 10 years in the NFL. “He was hiding it because he was the life of the party, and he was so socially important to the team. But I think he was struggling, and he was struggling silently, and I think it just became too much for him,\" Dr. McKee shared in an <a href=\"https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-diego-news/the-legacy-of-chargers-icon-junior-seau-ten-years-after-his-death\">interview with 10 News San Diego</a>.\n\nTwenty percent of CTE victims never experience a concussion. But the smaller hits, known as sub-concussive hits, and the length of a player’s career, are more likely to predict CTE; and therefore, memory loss and associated symptoms.\n\nThe NFL has since been forced to recognize the dangers of the sport and compensate players for their service. They have invested heavily in protective gear, modified penalties for hits and established a more rigid concussion protocol. Still, for the third time this season, the Dolphins quarterback experienced a harsh blow. Critics continue to call for stiffer penalties for teams and better protection for players.\n<h2>Cognitive Testing to Minimize CTE</h2>\nFootball and baseball players are not the only ones risking their brain health for the sake of their sport. Soccer players are also not immune. In Scotland, scientists found former professional footballers (soccer players to those in the United States) were around five times as likely to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Researchers there now use a program called SCORES (Screening Cognitive Outcomes after Repetitive head impact Exposure in Sport).\n\n“The idea is to protect people before they get injured by conducting cognitive and behavioral tests online and in people's homes, so they don't have to go into a laboratory,\" shared Dr. Michael Grey, Reader in Rehabilitation Neuroscience, University of East Anglia in <a href=\"https://insights.omnia-health.com/clinical/decoding-link-between-football-headers-and-dementia\">an interview with Omnia Health</a>. Through SCORES, brain health and sleep patterns are evaluated every three months through testing and questionnaires which take about 30 minutes to complete.\n\nMy kids stuck to track, volleyball and golf, for which I am eternally grateful. While I am a sports fan, I’ve walked on the other side of people experiencing dementia and cognitive misfunctioning, like those caregivers for former NFL players. There are too many difficult moments that occur in sports, no matter who you cheer for. In my home, I’ll cheer for long-term brain health.\n\n<strong>Annette Januzzi Wick</strong> is a writer, speaker, and author of <em>I’ll Have Some of Yours, </em>a journey of cookies and caregiving.<em> (Three Arch Press)</em>.

    "Title": "Managing Stress Through Your Body, Mind and Spirit",
    "Content": "We have all experienced our stress levels ebb and flow with time. But did you know that your age and gender have a direct correlation to the amount of stress that you are experiencing?\n\nFor women, stress often decreases as they age, with many women over the age of 50 stating that they feel less stressed, less worried and less angry than they did throughout their younger years. For men, the script is flipped. Men often state that they feel more stress as they mature.\n\nNo matter what stage of life you’re in, it’s important to check in with yourself to see where your stress levels are at, and if there is something you can do to help manage it.\n\nStress can affect every aspect of your being, so it’s important to not take a one-part approach to address stress. “Recognize how stress is impacting your mind, your body and your spirit,” Sierra Farmer, MSW, LISW-S, CEAP, with ProMedica's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) recommends.\n<h2>Mind</h2>\nAre you noticing that you are more forgetful than normal? Perhaps you often can’t remember where you put the car keys, you can’t seem to find the right words to express your thoughts or you can’t quite put a finger on that acquaintance’s name. All of these things could be signs of stress. When we are stressed, our short-term memory decreases and chronic stress can even impede the brain’s ability to function.\n\nAre your thoughts typically negative? Farmer challenges her clients to shut down those negative thoughts with an exercise. “At the end of each day, write down three things that went well and something you’re looking forward to tomorrow,” Farmer shares.\n\nAlso, consider the intention behind your actions. “If something you’re doing doesn’t align with your values, your peace or your purpose, it might be time to let go of it,” Farmer shares. Taking unnecessary things off your plate is a great way to lighten your load and relieve stress.\n<h2>Body</h2>\nStressed people often experience more aches and pains, have higher blood pressure and may even experience a longer healing time of physical wounds.\n\nAs much as your body may not feel up to it, movement can often be the best medicine. “Give yourself grace and do your best to at least stretch every day,” Farmer encourages. Also, make sure that you are fueling your body with a well-balanced diet and enough water and sleep.\n<h2>Spirit</h2>\nMarsha Drees, MSSA, LISW-S, CEAP, with ProMedica's Employee Assistance Program (EAP), explains that stress may manifest itself in your spiritual life when you begin to feel a lack of purpose, meaning or peace. Perhaps you feel disconnected from others and unmotivated to pray, meditate or engage spiritually.\n\n“This isn’t uncommon when you’re dealing with a loss or faced with a terminal illness, but it really can happen at any stage in life and with any stressor,” Drees shares.\n\nThrough everyday life, and especially when faced with stress, it’s important to set aside time to do the things that you love and that you know your body needs.\n\n“Watch for the signs of stress and don’t pass over them or keep powering through. Take time to practice some self-care,” Drees recommends. Whether that is getting outside for a walk, praying or going to the gym, you will be better able to serve and engage those around you when you take much needed time for yourself.\n\nLearn more about managing stress from Sierra Farmer, MSW, LISW-S, CEAP and Marsha Drees, MSSA, LISW-S, CEAP, in these episodes of <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/podcasts/happily-ever-after-40/\"><em>Happily Ever After 40</em></a>: <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48574\">Managing Your Stress: Part 1</a> and <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48575\">Managing Your Stress: Part 2</a>.",

    "Title": "Women, are you planning for your future health?",
    "Content": "Women tend to have a pretty good handle on planning – whether it’s for your career, family or friends, you’ve got it down. But are you setting aside the time to plan for your own future health and well-being?\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kanchan-pillai-md-facp-internal-medicine\">Kanchan Pillai, MD, FACP</a>, FOMA, a specialist in internal and obesity medicine with ProMedica Physicians, explains the importance of planning for future health, and how you can make sure that you are on the right track to healthy aging.\n\n“The rate at which aging happens is different for everyone,” Dr. Pillai explains. “Even within an individual body, the rate at which different organs age is different.” This rate is influenced by genetics, lifestyle and environmental exposure. While we can’t change our genetics, we can modify our environment and change our lifestyle to positively impact aging.\n\nDr. Pillai offers six actions that you can take today to plan for a healthier future:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Eat a well-balanced diet.</strong> A diet rich in fruit and vegetables and balanced with lean protein and whole grains is integral to maintaining health.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong> Get moving for at least 150 minutes per week to maintain general health and well-being. If you’re looking to lose weight, you will need to exercise more frequently.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Avoid smoking.</strong> Smoking is a major contributor to disease and an early decline in health. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation\">Stop smoking</a> to improve your health now and in the future.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get the recommended health screenings.</strong> Visit your doctor at least once a year for a well-being check and follow through with the recommended screenings for your age and medical history.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Manage stress.</strong> Chronic stress is one of the main causes of physical decline earlier than expected. Manage your stress by practicing mindfulness and doing the things that you love.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get the right amount of sleep.</strong> Sleeping too little (less than five hours) or too much (more than 10 hours) each night is associated with weight gain. Aim for 7-9 hours per night to give your body the rest that it needs.</li>\n</ol>\nLearn more about women planning for a healthy future in the <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48183\">most recent episode</a> of <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/podcasts/happily-ever-after-40/\"><em>Happily Ever After 40</em></a>, a podcast brought to you by ProMedica.

    "Title": "3 Simple Steps To Prepare for the 2023 Tax Season",
    "Content": "Once again, tax season is upon us. If you aren’t already aware, the 2023 tax season (with 2022’s tax returns) is shaping up to be quite different compared to the 2022 tax season (with 2021’s tax returns).\n\nMany experts expect refunds to be smaller than last year. This is because last year refunds were boosted by extended credits to help taxpayers recover from the shock of the pandemic. This year, most of those benefits will no longer apply, causing many of us to receive smaller returns than we did last year.\n<h2>Changes to Tax Credits</h2>\nSome credits that will return to pre-pandemic levels include the child tax credit, earned income tax credit, and child and dependent care credit.\n\nHere are the basics:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Those who received $3,600 per dependent in 2021 for the child tax credit will receive $2,000 per dependent for the 2022 tax year (if eligible).</li>\n \t<li>For the earned income tax credit, eligible taxpayers with no children who received roughly $1,500 in 2021 will now receive $500 in 2022.</li>\n \t<li>The child and dependent care credit will return to a maximum of $2,100 in 2022 instead of the 2021 maximum of $8,000.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Make the Tax Season Easier</h2>\nUnfortunately, there is nothing you can do about the changes to these credits. However, there are things that you can and should do to reduce your stress this tax season. Get ready for the 2023 tax season by taking these three important steps.\n<h3>1. Gather your documents.</h3>\nFew things cause the tax preparation process to drag on more than not having all the documents necessary to file ready to go. Make sure that you and your dependents’ identification is up to date (not expired) and matches your other documentation. Gather documentation for ALL sources of income. That would include W-2s from your employer, various 1099s for unemployment, retirement plan distributions, self-employment (including side hustles), etc. <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/checklist-for-free-tax-return-preparation\">View</a> a full list of what to bring.\n<h3>2. Verify your bank information.</h3>\nTo avoid delays in receiving your refund, double- or even triple-check your bank account information. Many of us elect to receive our refunds by direct deposit to get the refund back faster. When your bank information is incorrect, the IRS may reject the return itself or your bank may reject the deposit. In some cases, the IRS could also opt to send you a paper check instead of direct deposit, which could take several weeks to receive. Before your appointment, double- or even triple-check your bank information to avoid delays.\n<h3>3. Make a Tax Day plan.</h3>\nWho is preparing your return? What time is your appointment? Should you get a babysitter? Gathering all the proper documents will save you time during your appointment. Knowing where you’re going and how to get there, whom you are working with and minimizing distractions are important factors for reducing the stress of this process. Take a little time in the week and days before your appointment to be sure that you have all your ducks lined up to make the day flow smoothly.\n\n<em>ProMedica Financial Wellness Network (FWN) offers free financial coaching in a group and one-on-one setting to people of all zip codes and incomes.

    "Title": "Prioritizing Self-Care in Your Everyday Life",
    "Content": "Self-care is an important part of health and well-being that’s often ignored. Although often promoted as self-indulgence, it’s not about spending in excess or overindulging in junk foods.\n\n“Self-care is creating a life that you don’t feel like you have to escape from,” explains Jackie Van Zile, MA, LPCC, LCDC-III, a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\">ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</a>. “It’s rebalancing yourself when you feel out of balance and making time to take care of yourself because you’re important and you’re worth it.”\n\nTake a moment to look at the different aspects of your life (occupational, financial, home life, physical health, emotional health, etc.) and determine if any of them feel a little out of balance. If you do find that one feels a little off, prioritize the time to work on that part of your life. The good news is that when we work on one aspect, the others tend to improve right alongside it.\n<h2>How To Practice Self-Care</h2>\nSelf-care doesn’t have to be something big or extravagant. It can be something as simple as going for a walk to get some fresh air, picking up your living room to feel more organized or wearing clothes that fit well so you feel more comfortable and confident.\n\nVan Zile recommends practical self-care practices such as yoga, meditation, diaphragmatic (deep) breathing, striking a superhero pose or keeping a schedule. “Acknowledging your efforts and congratulating yourself for things that you’ve done can also be a great way to practice self-care, even if it’s something as simple as patting yourself on the back,” Van Zile shares.\n\nRemember that it’s not selfish to take care of yourself. “You are just as important as whatever is on your list of priorities,” Van Zile emphasizes. “Take care of yourself because your life is worth living rather than just surviving.”\n\nLastly, seeing a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/behavioral-health\">behavioral health specialist</a> can be a great way to practice self-care. They can be a sounding board to bounce ideas off of and help you navigate where to start on your self-care journey.\n\nLearn more about self-care from Van Zile <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48311\">in this podcast episode</a> of <em>Happily Ever After 40</em>.",

    "Title": "Coping With Holiday Stress",
    "Content": "Family drama, pressures of hosting or planning a gathering, decreased daylight hours, grief reminders and emotional expectations of yourself and others can all contribute to increased stress around the holiday season.\n\nPractice these six behaviors to prepare and help you cope with extra stress around the holiday season.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Increase self-care.</span></h2>\nThe best way to prepare for an event that is causing you stress is to continue doing the things you love. Whether that’s listening to music, going for walks, getting together with friends, exercising or taking a bath – make time for yourself in the days, weeks and months leading up to the stressful event.\n\n“The higher your stress level, the more time you should spend practicing self-care,” shares Jackie Van Zile, MA, LPCC, LCDC-III, a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\">ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</a>. “More often than not, our self-care is the first thing to go when we are experiencing stress. It’s important to keep it at the top of the to-do list to help keep your stress levels more manageable.”\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Don’t over-commit.</span></h2>\nIt’s OK to say no if you don’t have the time for a particular event this year. There is no sense in jamming your schedule so full that you have no time to enjoy the season. We don’t have to “make up” for lost time, this is a new Christmas.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Set expectations.</span></h2>\nBe proactive in your communications with your friends and family. If you only plan to attend an event for an hour, tell the host ahead of time so that clear expectations are set, and no one is surprised by your plans.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Make a spending plan.</span></h2>\nTake a look at your finances and stick to a budget to ensure that you don’t overspend. “Bills will still need to be paid after the holidays. <a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/general-health/how-to-have-happy-wallet-this-holiday-season/\">Budgeting ahead of time</a> can be very helpful to make sure you’re able to still pay for your necessities,” Van Zile shares.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Define your purpose.</span></h2>\nWhat is your purpose for celebrating this holiday season? Maybe it’s to spend time with family or enjoy time with friends. Whatever it is, remember this purpose in times of stress to recenter yourself.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Join a support group.</span></h2>\nIf you experience increased grief or trauma around the holiday season, joining a local support group might help. “Being able to connect with people who are experiencing the same kinds of things around the same time of year can really help you to not feel so alone,” Van Zile shares.\n\nAt the end of the day, it’s important to remember that if you are overstressed and the thought of adding one more event to your plate feels like it will put you over the edge, you don’t have to go. However, with purpose in mind, and the right preparation and boundaries set ahead of time, your stress levels can be more manageable.\n\n“You can handle this season this year – you’ve handled it before! It’s possible to have a good time even if you’re a little stressed. If you can find some of the magic in the season that can make a big difference,” Van Zile encourages.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jacquelyn-van-zile-ma-lpcc-cdca-counseling-and-therapy\"><em>Jacquelyn Van Zile,  MA, LPCC, LCDC-III</em></a><em>, is a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\"><em>ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</em></a><em> and has worked in the mental health field for the past 8 years.

    "Title": "5 Ways to Have a Healthy Holiday Season",
    "Content": "The holiday season is the perfect opportunity to spend time with loved ones, enjoy great food and create new memories. While it may seem difficult, keeping healthy habits in mind during the holiday season can make a big difference in one’s overall health and in your enjoyment of the holiday season.\n<h2>Moderation is Key</h2>\nIt is easy to consume more calories than usual during the holidays with all the feasts and celebrations we attend. But there is no need to swear off your favorite holiday foods. Remember that any food is okay in moderation. You just need a plan to get you through those parties.\n\nBefore filling your plate, take a walk around the food table to see your choices. This can help reduce the amount of food you put on your plate. Also, fill up on vegetables and fruits before going for calorie-dense main courses and desserts. Even something as small as drinking a glass of water before sitting down to eat can make a difference in your appetite.\n<h2>Keep Up With Exercise</h2>\nThe holiday season is usually a busy time. Keeping up with an exercise routine might be the last thing on your mind. So, change it up. Make it holiday friendly. Move in different ways.\n\nInstead of having your groceries delivered, grab a cart, walk around the store and do your own shopping. Park your car further away from entrances to get in a few extra steps. Take the stairs.  Do extra cleaning around the house. And, dance the night away at holiday parties. Enjoy the music and extra time moving.\n<h2>Use Healthy Alternatives When Cooking</h2>\nThere are several healthy changes that can be made to your favorite recipes that no one will notice.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Use unsweetened applesauce instead of oil in baked goods. One cup of oil is equal to one cup of applesauce.</li>\n \t<li>Replace sour cream with non-fat plain Greek yogurt in your favorite holiday dips.</li>\n \t<li>Be mindful of the amount of butter you use. Butter is very high in calories. A single tablespoon of butter has around 100 calories. Instead, try a low-calorie spray instead.</li>\n</ul>\nLoading up on healthy foods such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, beans and lean meats can help to reduce the risk of heart disease and diabetes.\n<h2>Manage Stress</h2>\nThe holidays can bring out a lot of emotions for people. For some, the stress of the holiday season increases their blood pressure. High blood pressure increases our risk for heart disease, heart attack and stroke.\n\nSo, focus on managing your stress. Exercising, deep breathing, meditating and talking to a close friend or family member are all things that can help relieve stress. If it gets to be too much, it’s okay to seek professional support for help with managing feelings of stress.\n<h2>Protect Your Heart Health</h2>\nOverindulging in salty foods and alcohol can lead to holiday heart syndrome. While overindulging during any time of the year can cause adverse effects, it most commonly occurs during the season when we tend to indulge the most. Consuming too much alcohol and salt can cause the heart to beat irregularly, commonly known as atrial fibrillation (AFib). Symptoms of AFib include shortness of breath, heart palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain and fatigue.\n\nIn addition, heart attacks are more common during the holiday season. Make sure you know the signs of a heart attack. Chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness and upper body discomfort can all be signs of a heart attack. If someone is suspected of having a heart attack, call 9-1-1 right away.",

    "Title": "Is fluoride important to dental health?",
    "Content": "Fluoride is a naturally occurring mineral that is released from the earth’s crust and found in our soil, water, air and some foods we eat or drink. In the past century, fluoride has also been added to many water supplies across the United States and to dental hygiene products such as toothpaste and mouthwash.\n\nTerry Norris, DMD, the lead consulting dentist for Paramount Dental, discusses fluoride’s history, use and benefits to dental health.\n<h2>History of Fluoride and Dental Health</h2>\nThe connection between fluoride and healthy teeth was first recognized by dentists when they began noticing lower numbers of dental caries (cavities) in those who drank water with naturally occurring fluoride.\n\nIn 1945, Grand Rapids, Michigan, became the first city to fluoridate its water supply. After seeing fewer cavities in school-age children in Grand Rapids, controlled fluoridation of water supplies received their endorsement. Today, just over 75 years later, 67% of Americans receive fluoridated tap water.\n\nFluoridated water supplies were not the only source of fluoride added to everyday life. In 1956, Crest released the world’s first fluoride toothpaste. Today, your options for fluoridated dental products expand a whole aisle at the pharmacy or grocery store.\n<h2>How does fluoride prevent cavities?</h2>\nFluoride prevents cavities in several unique ways. It has antimicrobial properties that repel the bacteria that cause cavities. Fluoride also disturbs pH levels<strong>.</strong> Bacteria must maintain a neutral pH to survive and grow. When fluoride is present, the pH level is disturbed, and bacteria must use more energy to maintain a neutral pH and therefore have less energy to grow.\n\n“Fluoride has a two-prong approach in preventing cavities: systemic and topical,” Dr. Norris explains. “Fluoride in municipal water systems works systemically on the inside of the tooth to strengthen a key mineral during tooth formation. Then, fluoride in toothpaste, mouthwash and water aid in decreasing the acidity of plaque and re-mineralizing damaged enamel to halt the progression of cavities and repair the damage.”\n<h2>Getting Your Daily Dose of Fluoride</h2>\nThe best way to receive an adequate intake of fluoride is through a combination of the following channels:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Fluoridated toothpaste:</strong> Look for toothpaste with the <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/ada-seal-of-acceptance\">American Dental Association (ADA) Seal of Acceptance</a>. The product must contain fluoride to receive the ADA Seal of Acceptance.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Fluoridated mouthwash:</strong> Look for a mouthwash that contains fluoride. Mouthwashes may contain breath-freshening agents but not fluoride.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Fluoride varnish:</strong> Fluoride varnish is applied to your teeth at each six-month dental cleaning. This special varnish is designed to release fluoride slowly, better protecting your teeth until your next cleaning.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Fluoridated water:</strong> Look online or contact your water utility provider to determine if your water is fluoridated. Some cities may add fluoride to their water source, while fluoride may be naturally occurring in other sources.</li>\n \t<li><strong>A balanced diet:</strong> Fluoride is naturally occurring in many foods and drinks. Higher concentrations of fluoride are found in potatoes, apples, spinach, black tea, coffee and wine.</li>\n</ul>\n“An adequate amount of fluoride can be obtained systemically through fluoridated water and eating foods that contain fluoride such as fruits and vegetables. Topical amounts of fluoride are available through fluoridated toothpaste and mouthwash. If your water is fluoridated there is no need for fluoride supplement drops,” Dr. Norris shares.\n<h2>Is fluoride toxic or bad for my overall health?</h2>\nAlthough rare, fluoride toxicity or overexposure can happen. “The main concern of too much fluoride occurs early in life, from infancy through early elementary school, when the teeth are forming prior to coming into the mouth,” Dr. Norris shares. However, when used with supervision, fluoride proves to be a powerful tool in promoting and maintaining good oral health in children.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children begin using fluoridated toothpaste in small quantities as soon as they get their first tooth; just a rice-sized amount is recommended for children under three. Then, beginning at three, most children may brush with a pea-sized amount of fluoridated toothpaste.\n\nIf you have concerns about getting too much or too little fluoride, contact your local health department to see if your water is fluoridated and falls within governmental guidelines. If it is not fluoridated, they can recommend a fluoride supplement and dosage amount.\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about topical fluoride treatments such as toothpaste or mouthwash, ask your dentist at your next appointment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<em>Sources</em>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851520/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851520/</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195894/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6195894/</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm\">https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5014a1.htm</a>",

    "Title": "Financial Planning for the New Year",
    "Content": "So, how did you do? You know, with those pesky New Year’s resolutions you began thinking about around this time last year.\n\nMany Americans add some form of a financial objective as part of their new year’s ideas. The most common of these include paying down debt, better budgeting to spend less and save more, and cutting expenses.\n\nThe challenge for many people is that <em>saying</em> that you want to do a thing is not the same as <em>planning</em> to do the thing. To increase the likelihood of achieving your financial goals in the new year, take a moment to reflect on what you learned about your personal money habits in 2022. Use that knowledge to your advantage to build a winning financial plan for 2023.\n\nFirst, start by asking yourself:\n\n<strong>Where did you succeed?</strong> Where did you win with money? Did you stick to your spending plan? Did you get those credit cards paid off? Did you save for and take that vacation that you needed? Every win counts, no matter how small. Be sure to acknowledge each one.\n\n<strong>Where did you not succeed</strong>? Facing our missteps can be tough, but it is necessary for growth. Did you eat out more than you planned? Did you use the credit card because you just had to have that new thing? Either way, it’s OK. What is important is that during this time of reflection, you are honest with yourself about why and how you may have stumbled and what steps you can take to improve moving into the new year.\n\nNow that you have your foundation from this year’s lessons, let’s look into next year.\n\nWe recommend that you begin with <a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/general-health/getting-started-with-a-budget/\">creating a spending plan (budget).</a> Then, take a look at these opportunities that might not be on your financial planning radar:\n\n<strong>Prepare for tax season now.</strong> Did you have a major life change such as the birth of a child, going back to school or a job/income change? Any of these changes can have a major impact on both your tax liability and how much money you bring home regularly. Use the IRS <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator\">tax withholding estimator</a> to be sure that you won’t over or underpay in taxes in 2023.\n\n<strong>Review your auto insurance</strong>. When is the last time you shopped around for coverage? If it’s been a while, now may be the time. Though insurers use similar factors to determine rates, how they weigh those factors may differ which could mean savings for you. Use this <a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/car/average-cost-of-car-insurance/#by-state\">insurance comparison tool </a> to begin your search.\n\n<strong>Treat yourself</strong>. You work hard; you deserve to enjoy the fruits of your effort. Not building pleasures into your financial plans is a quick way to lose interest and hit those missteps. While eating out often is not advised, occasionally eating out is a great way to unwind and relax. There are countless low- or no-cost activities that you can do to have fun (within your budget). But if you <em>need</em> to go on that cruise and you can properly plan, save for it and, if it doesn’t interfere with your other financial goals, GO FOR IT.\n\n<em>ProMedica Financial Wellness Network (FWN) offers free financial coaching in a group and one-on-one setting to people of all zip codes and incomes.

    "Title": "10 Tips on Surviving the Holiday Blues",
    "Content": "While the holiday season is known to bring joy, peace and togetherness; stress, tension and loneliness can also creep into the picture. Take hold of your negative feelings this holiday season by putting these tips into action.\n<h2>1. Spend time with friends and family.</h2>\nDon’t isolate yourself this holiday season. Take initiative -- call a friend or someone you have lost touch with, go out or invite a friend over to see you. Don’t wait for others to meet your needs. Reach out, even when you don’t feel like socializing.\n<h2>2. Don’t try to do it all.</h2>\nGive yourself a break when preparing for the holidays. Prioritize what really needs to be done, allow time for yourself and give yourself the freedom to be less than perfect.\n<h2>3. Make a schedule.</h2>\nIf you’re spending time with a group of friends or family, save yourself some stress and plan ahead. Plan structured activities to keep everyone occupied, especially if there are family conflicts brewing beneath the surface. Try a jigsaw puzzle, decorating cookies or group games to encourage people to interact together in a lighthearted way.\n<h2>4. Communicate your needs.</h2>\nNo one can read your mind. Inform others of your preferences, needs and desires. Asking for and accepting help with holiday necessities can relieve you of a heavy burden.\n<h2>5. Focus on the positive.</h2>\nEmphasize what is good, not what is missing. Reflect on the good things that have happened in your life by listing the things that you are most grateful for. Avoid using holiday time with family as a forum to clear up conflicts or as a time to wish for all the things that you no longer have.\n<h2>6. Don’t overeat or overdrink.</h2>\nAlcohol is a depressant and can exaggerate the holiday blues. Sugar can wreak havoc in your system and cause your spirits and energy to crash as your blood sugar levels go down. Overeating may lead to a lack of self-esteem and feelings of guilt after the holidays. Use moderation when enjoying foods and drinks this holiday season.\n<h2>7. Limit your spending.</h2>\nFocus on spending time with family and friends during this holiday season rather than spending money, which may cause added anxiety. Make homemade gifts or food to share with your loved ones.\n<h2>8. Get some exercise.</h2>\nExercise raises your energy levels and helps fight off depression. Exercise outside for the added benefit of getting some vitamin D from the sun!\n<h2>9. Do something for someone else.</h2>\nGive the gift of time or talent this season - volunteer, contribute financially or donate clothes, gifts or food to a local organization.\n<h2>10. Try something new.</h2>\nExperiment with new recipes, attend a holiday concert or play, join a club or try a craft project. Also, don’t forget about the classic holiday activities that you can enjoy free of charge, like looking at the holiday decorations or window shopping without buying anything.\n\nIf you are feeling the holiday blues this year, remember that you’re not alone. It’s impossible to feel happy, grateful and joyful throughout every moment of the holiday season. Don’t let the inevitable moments of sadness, fatigue or anxiety throw you off course – practice these tips to help you shake the blues.\n\n<em>Everyone feels down sometimes. If your holiday blues are constant and keep you from doing the things you love, talk to your </em><em>primary care provider</em><em> for help. </em><a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/body-and-conditions/how-self-care-can-help-minimize-depression/\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about the symptoms of depression and self-care strategies that can support your mental health. </em>",

    "Title": "Spirituality and Health: Are they connected?",
    "Content": "Spirituality, being the way that individuals seek meaning and purpose, is practiced by many people around the world. No matter the faith, spiritual practice or religion, spirituality often helps us find comfort and direction in our lives. But can it have an impact on our physical health and well-being?\n\nKen Papenhagen, senior manager of ProMedica Mission Services, shares three characteristics of people who practice spirituality:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Improved health.</strong> According to a Harvard study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, spiritual people live an overall healthier life, have greater longevity, less depression, lower rates of suicide and less substance abuse.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Less stress.</strong> Individuals with spirituality have less stress and more resiliency. Their ability to succeed in crisis situations is stronger because they have something to fall back on.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Improved community.</strong> Spiritual people are able to form a community with like-minded people. Through this community, they are able to see the world in a similar way and navigate life’s struggles and share life’s victories together.</li>\n</ol>\nLearn more about how spirituality affects our health <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48180\">in this episode</a> of <em>Happily Ever After 40</em>. <em>Happily Ever After 40</em> is a podcast brought to you by ProMedica that explores the joys and challenges that many experience during midlife.

    "Title": "Persisting on Your Journey To Quit Smoking",
    "Content": "Quitting smoking is a journey, and more often than not there are some bumps in the road. Joel Nofziger, registered respiratory therapist at ProMedica Toledo Hospital, shares how hard it can be to quit smoking and how compassion and positivity can help you on the journey.\n\n“Quitting smoking, vaping or chewing tobacco isn’t easy,” says Nofziger. “Think about a pack-a-day smoker – 10 puffs per cigarette, 20 cigarettes a day. Over the course of the year, you will perform the hand-to-mouth movement over 73,000 times. It took time to learn to use nicotine, so be patient with yourself as you learn ways to get through your day without tobacco products.”\n\nThankfully, with the right strategies, it’s possible to get back on track after a slip and continue your journey to a tobacco- and nicotine-free life.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Don’t let a one-time slip turn into a relapse.</strong> You’re not a failure for slipping, you’re a success for trying to quit. If you do slip, don’t use it as an excuse to pick up another cigarette or vaping device. Once you do, it’s even easier to pick up the next one and the next one. Stop the slip from turning into a relapse by analyzing what happened that you weren’t prepared for and figure out how to handle the same situation next time that it happens.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stop negative self-defeating thoughts.</strong> Tell yourself that you have control and a choice over your actions. If you’re tempted to use tobacco again, call someone who has already quit and will support you in your journey.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Don’t tell yourself that a little nicotine is OK.</strong> Even one cigarette a day greatly increases your risk of health issues such as heart attack, stroke, lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Make a list of all of the reasons you decided to quit. </strong>Maybe you decided to quit to improve your health and reduce your risk of cancers or ending up on oxygen. Maybe you’re quitting to show someone that you can do it. You look forward to telling your physician that you quit, passing a nicotine drug test to get a better job, or providing a healthy smoke-free home for your children or grandchildren. Or to use all that money (over $2,500 a year for a pack-a-day smoker) to buy something that you’ve always wanted.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Focus on the positive.</strong> Mentally beating yourself up, or being berated by someone else, isn’t helpful. You deserve credit for your decision to keep trying to quit. Never give up. Remember, you learn more with every slip and every success.</li>\n</ol>\n<em>ProMedica wants to help you quit.

    "Title": "How To Have a Happy Wallet This Holiday Season",
    "Content": "Winter holiday shopping season is here already! Believe it or not, the time has quietly crept up on us. Or maybe not so quietly in fact. There has been no shortage of news and talk about rising inflation. Maybe in response to the news and the price of virtually everything going up, you were able to get ahead of the curve by starting your shopping early -- a tried and true method for holiday shopping success no matter what is going on with the economy.\n\nWhether this is true for you or not, it’s OK. There are still deals to be taken advantage of and savings to be gained. But these wins won’t happen by accident. You need to be intentional about your shopping process. You need a winning strategy.\n\nFollow these three tips to help you to win this holiday shopping season:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Make a spending plan</strong>. Start by considering for whom you <em>need</em> to buy gifts. Next, assign maximum spending amounts for each person on your list. If you know what you want to buy for each person you can begin to price shop; we will talk about that next. Don’t forget to include expenses beyond gifts in your spending plan. You should consider the cost of travel, decorations, hosting items and food. Make sure you calculate all food costs, including any extra takeout you might get to avoid cooking the day before the big event. How much might that dining out or takeout add to your budget? These are the types of expenses that if not included up front, can leave us wondering where all our money went when the season is over.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Price shop</strong> <strong>and look for discounts. </strong>Remember, Google is your friend. Use Google’s <a href=\"https://shopping.google.com/\">shopping page</a> to quickly compare prices for gifts that you have already identified. Whether your search is generic or a specific brand, Google will quickly search the web to find which retailers have what you’re looking for, and at what price are they selling it. Even if you decide to not shop online, this price comparison will give you a better idea of reasonable prices for the items that you are looking for. Some offline retailers may even be willing to price match. Go the extra mile and use discount, coupon and reward finders such as <a href=\"https://www.joinhoney.com/\">Honey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rakuten.com/\">Rakuten</a>, <a href=\"https://home.ibotta.com/\">Ibotta</a> and <a href=\"https://www.befrugal.com/\">BeFrugal</a> to maximize savings and cash back.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Put social media to work for you</strong>. If you are already scrolling through Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or Tik Tok, why not use the time to find deals to help you to win the season? Use hashtags such as #sale, #discount, #coupon and #savings to find money-saving opportunities. Just because one of these hashtags is used, doesn’t mean that every product is a good deal. Use this as a starting point for your comparison.</li>\n</ol>\n<em>If you need help thinking through any of the tips provided, the ProMedica Financial Opportunity (FOC) is here to help. </em><a href=\"https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ProMedicaFinancialOpportunityCenter@HCRMC.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/\"><em>Schedule</em></a><em> a confidential one-on-one appointment with a ProMedica Financial Opportunity Center financial coach to discuss your unique situation.

    "Title": "How To Reduce Food Waste at Home",
    "Content": "Food waste can happen anywhere along the food supply chain, from farms to the grocery store, to restaurants, and even at home. Both retailers and consumers are responsible for this waste. Perfectly edible foods are thrown away due to imperfect appearance of produce in stores, over-purchasing items leading to spoilage, misunderstanding food labeling and agricultural losses. <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sustainable-management-food/united-states-2030-food-loss-and-waste-reduction-goal\">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> considers food to be the most wasted item in the United States, with an estimated 30-40% of our total food supply being wasted. For the average American, that’s equivalent to about 300 pounds of food every year!\n\nWasted food most noticeably affects the cost of food production and how much money consumers end up spending. It can also mean wasted resources, such as the water used to grow the food, and extra space taken up in landfills. Food waste is especially important due to the number of food insecure households that exist in the United States, with <a href=\"https://map.feedingamerica.org/county/2020/overall/\">nearly 12% of households</a> in the United States having limited access to healthy food.\n<h2>Reducing Waste at Home</h2>\nThere are many easy ways you can help prevent food waste at home. Here are some quick tips to get you started:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Check what food you already have at home before you shop. <a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/wellness-articles/recipes/\">Look for recipes</a> that include these items so you can use them up first.</li>\n \t<li>Practice meal planning so that you avoid purchasing too much food at the store.</li>\n \t<li>Cook in batches and freeze extra portions of food you can’t eat right away.</li>\n \t<li>Learn to love leftovers! Get creative with making new meals out of last night’s dinner. Yesterday’s roasted turkey can be tomorrow’s turkey tacos.</li>\n \t<li>Keep perishable foods within plain sight. Opt for a fruit bowl on the table as an option for healthier snacks and use up more perishable items first.</li>\n \t<li>Store foods properly. Some produce lasts longer while refrigerated and other produce should be kept in a dry, dark environment. Here are <a href=\"https://fruitsandveggies.org/stories/storage-101/\">some tips</a> for storing produce.</li>\n \t<li>Wait to wash produce until right before you use it. This helps to preserve its shelf life.</li>\n \t<li>Try composting at home to limit the amount of waste that goes into landfills.</li>\n \t<li>Consider donating surplus dry goods to local food pantries!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Understanding Food Labels</h2>\nAnother key to preventing food waste is to know what the different dates on food labels mean. It is important to understand that <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/food-labeling/food-product-dating/food-product-dating\">food product dating</a> is often an indicator of quality and not necessarily safety.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Sell-by: </strong>This date is listed mainly for inventory purposes for stores. This is often used for perishable food items, but most foods can typically be consumed safely for multiple days past this date.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Best-by:</strong> Indicates the date for best flavor and quality. This is not an expiration date.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use-by:</strong> This date lists the recommendation from the manufacturer for best quality. Infant formula should not be used after this date; however, other foods are often still safe to eat.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>*Tip: Check Out the </em><a href=\"https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/foodkeeperapp/index.html\"><em>USDA’s FoodKeeper App</em></a><em> for tips on how long items last and where they are best stored. Most canned foods are still safe to eat for at last for 1-2 years after the date on the container.</em>\n\nTry choosing a few of the tips above to focus on as you get started in reducing your food waste at home!",

    "Title": "4 Ways to Protect Your Eye Health",
    "Content": "Did you know that vision loss is among the top ten causes of disability for adults in the United States? Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take now to protect your eyes and make sure they are as healthy as they can be. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/michele-schlagheck-od-optometry\">Michele Schlagheck, OD,</a> ProMedica Physicians Vision Associates – Toledo, shares how.\n<h2>Exercise daily and watch your weight.</h2>\nJust like the rest of your body, your eyes need a balanced diet and daily movement to be able to function at their best. Being overweight and having elevated blood pressure and cholesterol levels can cause eye problems, including diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration and age-related cataracts.\n\n“Eating the right foods and getting enough exercise is an often-overlooked form of preventive care. Especially when good nutrition and exercise can slow or prevent a variety of age-related eye problems altogether,” shares Dr. Schlagheck.\n\nCarrots aren’t the only food for eye health. Eat dark, leafy green vegetables such as spinach, kale and collard greens. Also enjoy nuts, berries and cold-water fish like salmon, tuna and halibut to maintain good eye health.\n<h2>Know your family’s eye health history.</h2>\nSpeak with your family members to find out what kind of vision issues they may have — some might not be obvious. Hereditary diseases include age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, corneal dystrophies, color blindness, optic atrophy and retinitis pigmentosa (the most common inherited disease). There’s even been genetic links to near-sightedness, far-sightedness, astigmatism and strabismus (when eye muscles don’t work together resulting in one eye turning in one direction and the other eye another). Share your family’s eye history with your eye doctor so that they can watch for signs of anything developing over time.\n<h2>Wear eye protection.</h2>\nWhether it’s sunny or cloudy, wearing sunglasses is one of the easiest ways that you can protect your eye health. Sunglasses help protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, which are present even on cloudy days. Choose sunglasses that offer both UVA and UVB light protection and are polarized. Exposure to UV light can speed up cataract formation and macular degeneration, damaging your vision down the road.\n\nYou should also avoid tanning beds as they expose you to a high level of UV light. If you do choose to use a tanning facility, make sure you wear protective eyewear. It’s best to buy your own so they’ll fit your eyes snugly. If you do use a facility’s goggles, make sure they’re sterilized so you don’t risk getting an infection from another customer.\n\nAdditionally, be sure to wear protective eyewear when playing sports, performing home renovation projects or doing yard work. Protective eyewear will help stop stray debris from flying back into your eyes. Fog-free goggles work great for all these situations.\n<h2>Don’t skip your dilated annual eye exam.</h2>\nEye exams are important for eye health and overall health. You may think that an eye exam is not necessary if your eyesight is good, but often eye issues are not discoverable by the naked eye – you may not even have any issues with your eyesight! The only way to check if your eyes are healthy is to have your eye doctor perform a dilated eye exam.\n\nDr. Schlagheck explains the importance of receiving <strong>dilated</strong> eye exams: “Instead of looking through a keyhole, we are able to open the door and actually look in when eyes are dilated. We have a much wider field of view to look for any problems.”\n\nWhen your eyes are dilated, your eye doctor can peer into the peripheral part of your retina. They will check for abnormalities such as melanoma, discover retinal tears before they turn into detachments, detect any optic swelling, notice conditions related to hypertension, diabetes and thyroid conditions, and even detect toxicities to medications or supplements. Many eye issues cannot be cured, but progression can be slowed, or even stopped if caught early enough.\n\nYour eyes help you experience the world around you – don’t take them for granted.\n\n<em>Learn more about eye care and protection on </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/eye-care-adult\"><em>ProMedica’s website.</em></a>",

    "Title": "Building a Simple Skin Care Routine",
    "Content": "From extensive skin care routines to trendy new tools, it can be difficult to know where to start when you are looking to begin or improve your skin care routine.\n\nJanae Kaiser, an aesthetician at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/nu-el-a-lifetime-boutique\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nu•él</a>, a skin health boutique located at ProMedica Defiance Regional Hospital, breaks it down so you know where to begin.\n<h2>Starting a Skin Care Routine</h2>\nIf you’re looking to begin or improve your skin care, make sure that these four things are incorporated into your routine:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Cleanser:</strong> To remove impurities, makeup and other debris from your skin.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Exfoliant:</strong> To slush away build-up of dead skin cells.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Toner:</strong> To remove excess oil and debris and balances skin’s pH.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Functional Hydrator:</strong> To aid in skin barrier function and extended hydration.</li>\n</ol>\nSelect your products based on your skin type. For example, if you have dry skin, look for a hydrating cleanser. If you have oily and acne-prone skin look for a foaming cleanser that has salicylic acid. If you have sensitive skin, look for a gentle cleanser. At <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/nu-el-a-lifetime-boutique\">Nu•él</a>, the team uses therapeutic and medical-grade skin care products from the <a href=\"https://zoskinhealth.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ZO Skin Health</a> line, as well as the Revision Skincare line.\n<h2>Facial Skin Care Tools</h2>\nIn terms of at-home skin care tools, Kaiser’s number one recommendation is ice rolling. An ice roller is a tool that you put in your freezer prior to use to get it nice and cold. “By rolling the tool on your face, you are able to reduce inflammation and redness and aid in lymphatic draining and skin tightening,” Kaiser explains.\n\nOther tools that Kaiser recommends include the gua sha, a scrapping massage tool that can help the curvature of your face look more toned and your jawline more pronounced and aid in lymphatic draining (getting waste from your lymph nodes out).\n\nIf you’re looking for even more of a facial refresh, schedule an appointment at a skin health boutique to get a facial. Kaiser’s favorite in-office tool to use is an ultrasonic skin scrubber, which offers a deep cleanse by removing blackheads and infusing serums.\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\nBeginning a facial skin care routine can do wonders for your overall skin health – whether you stick with the basics or get a little bit fancier and add in some skin care tools. “Using skin care products and tools can be very beneficial. You just have to know how to use them correctly and be consistent,” Kaiser explains. Get started with your skin health journey today!",

    "Title": "How Pets Impact Our Health",
    "Content": "Whether dog, cat or lizard, pets play an important role in many of our lives. Their unconditional love, boisterous personalities and happy-go-lucky demeanor can’t help but put a smile on your face. But did you know that the impact of pets goes beyond the surface? Pets can positively impact your overall mental and physical health. Malena Caruso, wellness specialist at ProMedica, shares about how pets impact our lives for the better.\n<h2>Mental Health Benefits</h2>\nPets impact our overall mental health for the better. Caruso explains that one of the main ways that they do this is by giving us something to care about outside of ourselves. “Sometimes we get so consumed in our own issues and thoughts,” Caruso says. “Having an external point of focus is really important to help us recenter and focus on what matters.”\n\nStudies over the years have proven that people who live alone without family members, friends or pets have a lower life expectancy. This is believed to be attributed to higher rates of depression and anxiety. Owning a pet is a great way to add companionship and bring a greater sense of purpose to your life.\n<h2>Physical Benefits</h2>\nPets often help get us live more of an active lifestyle. Maybe you take your pet for a walk every day, throw a ball or play with an interactive toy (such as a cat wand). Whatever you do, you’re doing more than you would without a pet around to do it with! Having a pet is also a great excuse to get outside more often. Getting your daily dose of Vitamin D from the sun is a great way to boost your mood and help regulate your body systems, leading to things like better sleep and a strengthened immune system.\n\n“We can learn so much from pets – from being present in every moment to living every moment like it’s our last,” Malena shares. “Take advantage of all that they are able to teach you!”\n\nBefore bringing a pet into your home, make sure your home (and lifestyle) is ready for the change. Talking with the local shelter or veterinarian is a great way to prep for your knew pet!\n\nEven if you are not able to own a pet of your own, you can still reap many of the benefits that pets offer and give back to homeless animals in your community by volunteering at a local shelter.\n\nLearn more about how pets impact our health in <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48090\">this podcast episode</a> of <em>Happily Ever After 40</em>.",

    "Title": "Caring for Your Parents As They Age",
    "Content": "As our parents age, our role as “child” often flips to “caregiver.” How do you navigate this new relationship with your parent and ensure they get the care they need?\n<h2>Be Present</h2>\nEnsure that someone is available to consistently check on their physical and mental health, and their living situation. During the time spent with you, you might notice if their memory, physical health, or personal hygiene begins to decline.\n\n“If you do notice a decline, it’s important to not make changes all at once, or right away. Changes should be made incrementally to not drastically disturb their daily routine,” shares Annette Januzzi Wick, ProMedica blogger and speaker.\n<h2>Be Open</h2>\n“We often think that as caregivers, we need to be the boss, make all the decisions and oversee everything that goes on in our parents’ lives,” Wick shares. However, our parents need us to let them be who they are. Let them lead the way and allow them to enjoy their freedom whenever possible.\n\nThey may not be the parent you remember them as – and that’s okay. “The more open that you can be to accepting who they are now, the more positive your visits and interactions with them will be,” Wick emphasizes.\n<h2>Care for Yourself, Too</h2>\nAs you enter your new role as caregiver of your parents, remember to not put your own health and well-being aside. Set yourself up for success by taking the following steps:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Practice self-care.</strong> Managing your parents’ care and your own life can be difficult. Make time for yourself and find outlets that help you relieve stress and bring you joy.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Find support.</strong> Create a support system of family and friends that understand what you’re going through and can listen when you need to talk.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Educate yourself.</strong> You don’t have to be an expert but staying informed about your parents’ wants and needs will help you feel more confident, especially later, when you’re making difficult decisions regarding their care.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Be honest with yourself.</strong> Determine what’s important to you and your relationship with your parents and keep that in mind as you make decisions regarding your loved one.</li>\n</ul>\nLearn more about caring for your parents as they age from ProMedica blogger and speaker, Annette Januzzi Wick.

    "Title": "Stomach Flu Dos and Don’ts",
    "Content": "You’re on your second sick day, thinking to yourself, “<em>How can I possibly be sick with the flu, I got my vaccine?” </em>But that pesky stomach bug that’s preventing you from eating anything, and perhaps forcing you into the bathroom more often than you’d like to admit, isn’t actually influenza, it’s likely another virus causing gastroenteritis.\n\n“Frequently, the word ‘flu’ is used interchangeably to discuss both influenza and viral gastroenteritis,” shares <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kara-wollenweber-cnp-family-medicine\">Kara Wollenweber,</a> a certified nurse practitioner with ProMedica Physicians. “But in fact, these are two very different illnesses.”\n\nWollenweber explains that influenza and stomach flu may appear similar, with patients experiencing symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and sometimes fever, muscle aches and headaches. However, influenza affects your respiratory system, including your nose, throat and lungs, while gastroenteritis goes after your intestines.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Identifying Symptoms of the Stomach Flu</span></h2>\nIf you have the stomach flu, you’re likely experiencing:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Sudden onset of diarrhea (three or more liquid stools for longer than 12 hours).</li>\n \t<li>Vomiting.</li>\n \t<li>Abdominal cramping, body aches or headache.</li>\n \t<li>Sometimes fever.</li>\n</ul>\n“These symptoms can likely be attributed to gastroenteritis, if no other cause can be identified such as stress, bowel disease, recent travel or recent use of antibiotics,” Wollenweber says.\n\nWollenweber warns that symptoms of the stomach flu do not develop until anywhere from two to ten days after exposure. Once symptoms appear, they typically resolve in one to four days, but may last longer depending on the virus. You are most contagious when you are actively sick and for up to two weeks after your symptoms disappear depending on the virus.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">How the Stomach Flu Spreads</span></h2>\nThe most common instigator of the stomach flu is something called a norovirus, which is spread by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces and other carriers of the virus. You can also get the stomach flu by ingesting contaminated food or water.\n\n“The virus spreads easily,” says Wollenweber. “But there are a few things you can do to help prevent others from getting sick.”\n\nStart by keeping a clean home. Wollenweber says that if you, or someone in your house is sick, you should wash your hands frequently and clean all surfaces, including your bed linens. Additionally, a person with the stomach flu should not prepare meals or share food or drinks with others, as the virus can easily contaminate food and water. Also, the virus can remain in your stool for up to two weeks after your symptoms go away, so frequent cleaning of bathroom surfaces is important, as well as continued, thorough hand washing.\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Remember To Drink Plenty of Liquids</span></h2>\nAsk any health care professional their advice for braving it through the stomach flu, and they’ll tell you to get some rest and drink plenty of liquids.\n\n“Dehydration is the leading concern for people of all ages who have the norovirus,” warns Wollenweber. “Older adults and small children are especially susceptible and should be monitored closely.”\n\nSymptoms to watch out for include decreased urination, dry mouth and dizziness when standing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends against giving medication to stop diarrhea in children under the age of three or if there is blood or mucous in the stool. Wollenweber adds, “In the case of bloody diarrhea or fever, you should follow up with your health care provider to rule out bacterial infections or parasites.”\n\nAdditionally, medication to stop vomiting or help with nausea should only be given to adults. Since the norovirus is a virus, antibiotics are not beneficial.\n<h2>Should you visit the doctor’s office if you have the stomach flu?</h2>\n“An evaluation by your primary care provider should be made if dehydration or suspected dehydration is a concern,” says Wollenweber. “To prevent dehydration or replace fluids, sports drinks and other non-caffeinated drinks may be used for mild dehydration. Optimally, a fluid and electrolyte oral replacement is best. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization and intra-venous fluid replacement.”\n\n<em>For specific guidelines on rehydration, or suspected dehydration, contact your </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\"><em>primary care provider</em></a><em>. To read more information about the stomach flu, please visit </em><a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/norovirus/about/index.html\"><em>the CDC’s website</em></a><em>.</em>",

    "Title": "Can children benefit from acupuncture?",
    "Content": "Acupuncture has been used for centuries to help alleviate various symptoms related to chronic pain, digestive issues, emotional conditions and stress. You may have heard of acupuncture and may know someone who has tried it. But did you know that acupuncture may be beneficial for children as well? When performed by an experienced acupuncturist, this therapy may be a safe way to help a child address pain or stress.\n\nIf you are considering acupuncture for your child, you may have many questions. Here are some common questions and important things to consider.\n<h2>Is acupuncture safe for kids?</h2>\nAcupuncture involves the insertion of very thin sterile needles. This practice can be very safe as long as the provider is trained and licensed. Always do homework on the provider’s credentials and experience! How deep the needles go into the skin and the length of the needles are all taken into consideration by the provider. Lighter, more shallow needling with shorter needles is often used when treating children.\n\nThe age of the child, body size and what is being treated are all factors that the acupuncturist considers when deciding how to treat. When treating adults, needles are usually left in place for 20-30 minutes to allow the person to relax and allow them to receive the benefits of the treatment. A child’s health needs can be different from adults so the acupuncture visit looks different based on this.\n\nAcupuncture can be done at any age, but is mostly used for adolescents and teens. On younger children, very short needles are used and are not left in for very long. Also, fewer needles are often used to treat children than adults.\n<h2>What if my child is afraid of needles?</h2>\nChildren usually have had several vaccines and “ouchy” things done at health care visits, so this can make them afraid of needles. A good provider will take this into consideration and take time to talk with you and your child on what the needles feel like and what to expect from the visit. Fear of needles doesn’t have to be a barrier to treatment; there are other non-needle options the acupuncturist can provide.\n\nAcupressure can be combined with acupuncture or useful on its own when trying to avoid needles. This involves pressing on the acupuncture points instead of needling them. Pressure can be held on the specific acupuncture points or the provider can gently massage the acupuncture points which is very soothing. The provider can also demonstrate acupressure techniques to the parent and child to use at home between their visits to support the child’s health.\n<h2>What health concerns may benefit from acupuncture?</h2>\nAcupuncture is a modality that has been used for thousands of years to support various health concerns. Adults can find acupuncture helpful for de-stressing, helping pain conditions and supporting well-being. For children, acupuncture can be helpful for more specific concerns such as digestive issues and upset belly. Acupuncture could also be used for helping the symptoms of anxiety. A child with anxiety might find it difficult to focus when trying to do schoolwork; acupuncture could help calm them, which in turn can help with focus. For older children who play sports, acupuncture, along with their current health plan, could help with muscle pain post-sports injury.\n\nIf you’re interested in seeking acupuncture therapy for your child, start by finding a trained and licensed acupuncturist who has experience working with children. You should also check in with your child’s pediatrician about any health concerns and how to incorporate this modality into their overall health plan.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7682 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Kylie_Professional-Photo3-267x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "Organic vs. Non-Organic | Does it really matter?",
    "Content": "We’ve all been faced with the green organic label at the grocery store – but is it really worth the extra money? Katie Van Buren, MS, RD, a registered dietitian at ProMedica Charles and Virginia Hickman Hospital, discusses what “organic” really means and if you should be concerned about buying it.\n<h2>Understanding Organic Foods</h2>\n<h3>What does it mean when food is organic?</h3>\nOrganic food is produced following rules and regulations set by the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) <a href=\"https://www.ams.usda.gov/about-ams/programs-offices/national-organic-program\">National Organic Program</a>. According to the USDA, “USDA certified organic foods are grown and processed according to federal guidelines addressing, among many factors, soil quality, animal raising practices, pest and weed control, and use of additives. Organic producers rely on natural substances and physical, mechanical, or biologically based farming methods to the fullest extent possible.”\n\nOrganic produce is produced without the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. Organic meat is produced without antibiotics and hormones, and animals are fed organic feed and are raised in living conditions that accommodate their natural behaviors.\n<h3>Are organic foods safer or healthier than non-organic foods?</h3>\nThere is no robust evidence to support the idea that organically produced foods are more nutritious than conventional (non-organic) alternatives. However, there are several things to consider when deciding between organic or conventional food:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Environmental impact:</strong> Organic farming is considered far more sustainable than conventional farming due to the exclusion of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, antibiotics and hormones.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Impact on agricultural communities:</strong> Growing organic has a positive impact on farming communities through improved soil, water and air quality, increased biodiversity and improved wildlife habitat.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Environmental exposure:</strong> Links to increased cases of ADHD and Alzheimer’s disease, lower IQ and impaired fetal growth have been found in individuals who live in agricultural communities with a high concentration of conventional farming. This data has been collected in multiple studies including the largest longitudinal study into health impacts of pesticides and environmental exposure, The Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas Study (CHAMACOS).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Occupational exposure:</strong> The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognizes links between conventional agriculture workers and respiratory conditions, various cancers and Parkinson’s disease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Organically produced foods are more costly than conventionally produced foods.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Access:</strong> Access to organic foods may be more limited than access to conventional foods.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Increasing Access to Fresh Produce</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-farms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ProMedica Farms</a>, located on the campus of ProMedica Charles and Virginia Hickman Hospital, is working to increase access to fresh produce in Lenawee County, Michigan. The three-acre farm was created to support ProMedica’s focus on addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH), or the aspects of health that take place outside the doctor’s office. With the help of local farmers and a slew of volunteers, ProMedica Farms is able to provide fresh, low-cost produce to the Lenawee community.\n\n“In the most recent growing season, we grew heaps of vegetables including beets, celery, green onion, potatoes, tomatoes, green and red bell peppers, watermelon, zucchini and butternut squash,” shares Amy Gilhouse, manager of ProMedica Farms. “All of these were grown organically without the use of chemicals. We rely on cultivating healthy soil, scouting for insects to maintain the health of plants and getting creative to deter insects with non-chemical means.”\n\nEvery week, community members are able to purchase the produce from ProMedica’s Veggie Mobile at one of its 17 stops throughout the community. ProMedica Farms also provides education for patients and community members about how to eat healthier and take advantage of seasonal produce grown in Michigan.\n\n“The response to food insecurity is often to provide shelf-stable products,” shares Frank Nagle, director of Community Impact for ProMedica in Michigan. “We are grateful for the opportunity to provide fresh, locally grown produce to the people of Lenawee county.”\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) only one in 10 Americans eat enough fruits and vegetables every day. “Don’t let the inability to purchase organic food stop you from eating conventional produce or meats,” Katie shares. “Instead, focus on consuming a variety of fruits and vegetables, thoroughly washing them before consuming – even if they are organic – and purchasing local when you’re able.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/social-determinants-of-health/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about ProMedica’s SDOH efforts in Lenawee County and beyond. </em>",

    "Title": "4 Tips To Achieve Credit Card Freedom",
    "Content": "Credit cards... those convenient little pieces of plastic that allow you the joy of buying now and paying later. When managed properly, they can be an effective tool in your money management strategy. On the other hand, well, life happens. Despite our best intentions and efforts, we may find ourselves stuck in what feels like an endless cycle of credit card payments draining our monthly budget and keeping us from meeting our larger financial goals.\n\nThe good news is that no matter how bad your situation feels, there is almost always a way to improve it.\n\nWhat you can’t afford to do is to continue to put off the fix. Here are a few reasons why you want to get started reducing your credit card debt today:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Reduce stress</strong>. Financial stress is a major contributor to both mental and physical health challenges. Get out of debt. Save yourself the stress.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Free up discretionary funds</strong>. Surely you have larger financial goals which you wish to accomplish. Or maybe you just want to enjoy life more. Either way, ongoing credit card payments will slow, if not completely stop you from getting to where you would like to be. Eliminating those payments will free up funds that can be used for a much needed vacation, to get work done on your car or to feel more secure about your retirement plans.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Improve credit score</strong>. Paying your creditors on time is the single most important factor for establishing and maintaining good credit. The next most important thing is keeping your credit balances low. Even if you pay on time every month, but your cards are maxed out, your scores may still stagnate. Getting your balances <u>below</u> 30% of your limits will help to improve your scores.</li>\n</ul>\nHere are a few of the practical tips that we suggest for putting you on the path to credit freedom:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Plan</strong>. All financial success begins with proper planning. Credit card freedom is no different. In this case, what matters is deciding which repayment strategy works best for you. Some prefer to use the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/what-is-a-debt-snowball\">debt snowball plan</a> (paying off credit cards in order from the smallest to the largest balance owed). Others prefer the <a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/what-is-a-debt-avalanche\">debt avalanche plan</a> (paying off credit cards in order from the highest to the lowest interest rate). Others prefer to consolidate their cards into one easy monthly payment. Still, others like to make extra payments above the minimum to pay the card off faster. What matters most is that whichever plan you choose, you stick with it.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Try cash</strong>. The simplicity of credit and debit cards and mobile payments have made cash almost nonexistent in our everyday lives. For the sake of realizing credit card freedom, cash can be a valuable friend. Paying for your purchases with cash instead of credit will help you separate your needs from wants, remain conscious about your spending, and make you think twice before spending money.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Talk to your creditors</strong>. Believe it or not, your credit card rates may not be set in stone. If you have been with a credit card issuer for some time and have maintained a positive payment history, they may be willing to reduce your interest rate to keep you as a customer. HINT: lower interest rates = lower monthly payments. By reducing the interest rate while maintaining your standard payment, you will effectively pay off the card faster.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Tighten your budget</strong>. Review your spending habits to find opportunities to save. Consider cutting back on expenses like online shopping, subscription services, eating out or entertainment; whatever you can sacrifice now to achieve your long-term goals. Use these savings to apply additional payments to your credit card debt. Anytime you can make more than the minimum payment on your credit card bills, you’re one step closer to being credit card debt-free.</li>\n</ol>\n<em>If you need help thinking through any of the tips provided, the ProMedica Financial Opportunity (FOC) is here to help. <a href=\"https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ProMedicaFinancialOpportunityCenter@HCRMC.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/\">Schedule</a> a confidential one-on-one appointment with a ProMedica Financial Opportunity Center financial coach to discuss your unique situation.

    "Title": "5 Oral Hygiene Mistakes You Might Be Making",
    "Content": "Did you know that your oral health is largely connected to your overall health and well-being? Terry Norris, DMD, the lead consulting dentist for Paramount Dental, shares common oral hygiene mistakes and what you can do to correct them to have better oral and overall health.\n<h2>1. Not maintaining good oral hygiene.</h2>\nThe worst mistake that you can make for your mouth is poor oral hygiene. Follow these recommendations daily for better oral health:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Brush regularly. </strong>Brush your teeth for at least two minutes at least twice a day – or even better, within 20 minutes of eating. Use a smooth or soft toothbrush with an <a href=\"https://www.ada.org/resources/research/science-and-research-institute/ada-seal-of-acceptance\">American Dental Association (ADA) approved</a> toothpaste with fluoride.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Floss daily.</strong> Floss your teeth at least once a day. Flossing is just as important as brushing as it gets little pieces of food unstuck from between your teeth and removes plaque and bacteria that cause decay and periodontitis (gum disease).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use mouthwash.</strong> Consider finishing your oral hygiene routine with fluorinated mouthwash. Mouthwash can help clean areas in and around the gums and re-mineralize the teeth. Avoid alcohol-based mouthwashes as they dry out the mouth, which may lead to tooth decay.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Drink water.</strong> Water is the best beverage for keeping your mouth healthy and hydrated. If you are looking for a drink other than water, avoid acidic beverages such as citrus juices, soft drinks and wine. The acid in the beverages can etch, or roughen up, the enamel. When the enamel gets etched, it collects plaque and bacteria easier, which causes the enamel to be eroded, resulting in tooth decay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Not having regular dental check-ups.</h2>\nSee your dentist for regular checkups and cleanings. You should be seeing the dentist every six months so that any issues can be caught early and your teeth can be cleaned by a professional.\n<h2>3. Not following up with recommended treatment.</h2>\nIt is important that you follow up with any treatment recommended by your dentist. It is best to receive treatment early on, even if it is not hurting yet.\n\n“If you catch a cavity when it is small, it’s easier to treat and results in a smaller filling and less trauma. If you put off recommended dental treatment until it hurts, you’re going to end up going through a lot more in the long run,” Dr. Norris shares.\n<h2>4. Waiting until it hurts to see a dentist.</h2>\nDon’t wait until you are experiencing pain to see the dentist. If you are going to your dentist for regular six-month checkups, they may be able to catch an issue, such as a small cavity or gum recession, before you experience any pain. The dentist may be able to recommend proactive oral health practices to resolve the issue or provide treatment before the issue worsens.\n<h2>5. Having teeth removed and/or not replacing missing teeth.</h2>\nKeep your teeth whenever possible – root canals and crowns work and allow you to keep your original teeth. If you have a missing or removed tooth, it is important to have a dental implant made to replace the tooth. Missing teeth can lead to chewing problems or temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ).\n\nYour oral health is more connected to your overall health and well-being than you may think. Periodontitis (gum disease) can lead to cardiovascular disease or stroke, the bacteria associated with periodontitis may be associated with the development of Alzheimer’s disease, and tooth loss can leave lasting damage on your jaw function and ability to chew.\n\n“The healthier the mouth, the healthier the body. The better that we care for our mouth and reduce that bacteria, the better our systemic health will be,” Dr. Norris shares. Often, the damage cannot be reversed after it is done. However, it can be stopped or slowed from progressing.\n\nIt’s not too late to correct poor habits. Begin brushing and flossing regularly, schedule regular checkups, replace any missing teeth and evaluate your diet.",

    "Content": "Although pediatric cancer is relatively rare, it is the leading cause of disease-related death in children and adolescents in the United States. According to the National Cancer Institute, 43 children are diagnosed with childhood cancer every day. However, cancer death rates in this age group have declined by 71% over the last 50 years.\n\nThe most common types of cancer among children are acute leukemias, brain tumors and lymphomas. Childhood cancers are very different than those that are seen in adults. While there are typically risk factors that can be altered to help prevent the risk of cancer in adults, most cases of childhood cancer are sporadic or related to inherited genetic mutations or disorders. It is important to know that if a child is diagnosed with cancer, there is typically nothing that could have been done to avoid the diagnosis.\n\nHowever, healthy habits started in childhood can help decrease the risk of cancer in adulthood, including a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, plenty of physical activity, consistent sunscreen use, and avoiding exposure to second-hand smoke.\n\nOver the past 60 years, there has been significant improvement in childhood cancer outcomes due to children and parents choosing to participate in clinical research. Many children and parents will choose to participate in trials to help prevent future children from having to go through the same situations. Because of this research, most children diagnosed with cancer will be cured.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jamie-l-dargart-md-pediatric-hematologyoncology?utm_campaign=reputation-management&amp;utm_segment=gmb_listing-link&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic-search\">Jamie Dargart, MD, MS</a>, is a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at ProMedica Russell J.

    "Title": "What is grounding and how can it improve your mental health?",
    "Content": "Do you ever feel stressed or overwhelmed and struggle to bring yourself back to a sense of calm or normalcy? Jacquelyn Van Zile, a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\">ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</a>, shares how grounding techniques might be able to help.\n<h2>What is grounding?</h2>\nGrounding is a set of simple techniques that help you bring yourself down from an extreme, emotional experience. Emotional experiences may be triggered by stress, anger, sadness, anxiety, substance cravings, trauma or flashbacks. “Grounding can help you self-regulate and get yourself to a more stable condition,” Van Zile shares.\n<h2>Grounding Techniques</h2>\nThere are three main categories of grounding techniques: mental, physical and soothing. Depending on the situation, you may find it helpful to use one or more from each category.\n<h3>Mental</h3>\nMental grounding techniques help you redirect your thoughts from negative, overwhelming or stressful feelings. Examples of mental grounding techniques include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Categories:</strong> Play a game of categories with yourself. Choose a specific category and name everything that you can think of that falls within that category. For example, if the category was “colors” you would name every color that you could think of until you couldn’t think of anymore.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Describe your environment: </strong>Look around the space you are in and describe it in detail, like you are describing it to someone over the phone. Be sure to use only facts and not emotion when practicing this. For example, you would say, “the walls are brown,” not, “the walls are an <em>ugly </em>brown.”</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Physical</h3>\nPhysical grounding techniques redirect your focus to something tangible or a bodily sensation. Examples of physical grounding techniques include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Use your senses:</strong> Find a strong smell such as mint, citrus, or even a bad smell to sniff. Or taste something with a strong flavor, such as a lemon, and describe the flavors that you are tasting.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Listen to music:</strong> Listening to music can be a great way to ground yourself – just be sure to choose music that you don’t have an emotional connection to.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Soothing</h3>\nSoothing grounding techniques direct your focus to the things that you like to help you remind yourself of who you are. Examples of soothing grounding techniques include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Favorites:</strong> Think of your favorite color, animal, season, etc. and focus on all the aspects that you like about that favorite item.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Photos:</strong> Keep photos of your favorite things close by to look at. Maybe it’s a photo of your favorite vacation spot, your family or your friends.</li>\n</ul>\nSometimes having someone practice these techniques with you can be helpful. The simple fact of having someone else present and hearing their voice can help ground you in and of itself.\n<h2>Why They Work</h2>\nGrounding techniques work because they distract our brain and allow our emotional processes to settle. “The lifespan of an emotion is about a minute and a half. If you stop yourself from thinking into the emotion, it will pass faster than if you feed it by thinking into it too much,\" Van Zile shares.\n\n“The more techniques that you have in your back pocket the better. You may need to go through a few to be able to effectively calm yourself,” shares Van Zile. “Practice when you don’t need it so that when you do need it you have the tools available.”\n\nDon't allow negative feelings to take hold - try grounding techniques next time you're feeling stressed or overwhelmed.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jacquelyn-van-zile-ma-lpcc-cdca-counseling-and-therapy\"><em>Jacquelyn Van Zile,  MA, LPCC, CDCA</em></a><em>, is a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\"><em>ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</em></a><em> and has worked in the mental health field for the past 8 years.

    "Title": "Art and Healing at Arden Courts – ProMedica Memory Care Communities",
    "Content": "Research shows that art is a powerful antidote. Whether it’s trauma, grief, illness or even physical pain, ProMedica knows art can help patients and residents heal in extraordinary ways.\n\nTerri Lalonde, director of lifestyle programming for Arden Courts - ProMedica Memory Care Communities, explains how art is used to promote healing in our Arden Courts communities.\n\nStaffed by specially trained caregivers, Arden Courts cares for individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. An individualized service plan is created for each resident based on their preferences, routines, abilities and interests – often, forms of art are integrated into those service plans.\n\nArt is a gift that provides opportunities for creativity, connection and purpose. The programming staff at Arden Courts develop art events for their residents and tailor those projects to meet their cognitive and physical abilities. For example, Arden Courts has capitalized on a resident’s seamstress skills by introducing a sewing circle that made quilts, placemats and potholders. Other examples at Arden Courts include painting using watercolors or acrylics, jewelry and accessory creation, crafting pottery or ceramics, photography groups where scrapbooks are made from the photos taken, or woodshop classes where birdhouses are made and Adirondack chairs are assembled and painted with beautiful scenes.\n\n“The dementia brain still requires movement, motion and stimulation. Art helps to stimulate different sectors of the brain that might not be engaged by playing a physical or cognitive game,” Lalonde explains. “Art can also help our residents who are having difficulty verbalizing thoughts or feelings express themselves and communicate with us through a different avenue.”\n\nArt invites residents to be creative while working to improve concentration and fine motor skills. Creating can also improve the quality of life of our residents. Lalonde explains some residents can’t wait to show off their artwork once it is complete. “Many residents love to post their artwork on the bulletin boards throughout the community and can’t wait to show their family members or friends who come to visit.”\n\nSome residents will even reminisce the past as they are creating, which helps to strengthen their memory. Perhaps the flower that they are painting reminds them of their time gardening, or they talk about the art they created with their children or as a child themselves.\n\nThe possibilities are endless when it comes to the power of art. Lalonde recalls a time that art helped to turn a resident’s mood around. “She was really having a bad day and not wanting to engage in the art project. However, after sitting and talking with our program director for a bit, she decided to pick up a paintbrush and begin painting some lines on the canvas. By the end of the activity, she had created a colorful canvas and was smiling and chatting with other residents about what she had created,” Lalonde shares.\n\nRecently, residents across the country worked together on a collaborative piece of artwork for the <a href=\"https://events.handbid.com/auctions/arden-courts-online-art-auction\">Arden Courts Online Art Auction</a>, happening September 9 - September 23, 2022. Lalonde remarked that it was amazing to see residents working together on projects and building friendships with each other while creating.\n\nThe best thing about art is that there is no right or wrong answer when creating. Encouraging residents to participate in art allows them to be expressive, provides opportunities to interact with other residents and helps to achieve more emotional fulfillment in their day to day.\n\n“The smiles that we see during the artistic process, the sharing of the stories and memories, the complimenting of each other’s work – it’s so beautiful to see among our residents,” Lalonde shares.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.arden-courts.org/\"><em>Learn more</em></a><em> about Arden Courts and the success-oriented, engaging programs offered to residents living with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias. </em>",

    "Title": "How To Build Wealth for Future Generations",
    "Content": "There is a saying that goes, “It doesn’t matter where you start, it matters where you end up.” For some aspects of life, that saying might very well be true. But when it comes to financial health and well-being, where you start matters a lot.\n\nMany of us know firsthand the challenges that come with starting and getting through life without a strong financial foundation to stand on. Often, that drives us to find and create opportunities for our children to start from a better position than we did - because where they start really does matter. We refer to this as generational financial security or generational wealth-building.\n\n<strong>What is generational wealth?</strong> Generational wealth is any assets passed down by one generation of a family to another.\n\nGenerational wealth looks different and unique for every family based on many factors. In a perfect world, each family would be able to secure an investment portfolio to provide that security. However, since we don’t live in a perfect world, here are a few simple steps and financial products that can help you get future generations off to a comfortable financial start.\n<h2>3 Simple Ways To Build Generational Wealth</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Change your mindset</strong>. Recognize that building this base means laying the foundation brick by brick. That means one step at a time. It’s not about how much you start with, it’s about making up your mind to get started.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Create a budget</strong>. You can read our previous post, <a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/general-health/getting-started-with-a-budget/\">Getting Started With a Budget</a>, for the steps to accomplish this.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Pay down debt. </strong>Reducing and eliminating debt will free up cash that can be saved or turned into assets.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Generational Wealth-Building Products</h2>\nOnce your spending, saving and debt plans are in place, you can start to research which generational wealth-building products might benefit you the most. Here are a few examples:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Homeownership</strong>. Historically, homeownership has proven to be an effective means of building wealth by creating equity (the value of what you own).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Child savings accounts</strong>. Start saving for your child’s future. These accounts usually carry no fees and a minimum starting balance. Deposits can be made by parents, family or the child themselves. Additionally, getting the children involved in the savings plan process will provide them a valuable financial education on banking, and it give them a sense of ownership and accomplishment.</li>\n \t<li><strong>529 college plans</strong>. Start saving for your child’s college expenses. Savings from a 529 college plan can be withdrawn tax-free to cover almost any type of college expense and there are usually other state and federal tax benefits.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Custodial account</strong> These are a type of tax beneficial investment vehicle that enables an adult to set up an investment account on behalf of a child beneficiary.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Life insurance</strong>. This product is key to the family’s ability to pay off debt and pass wealth to the next generation.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Estate planning</strong>. The written plan to distribute assets to the next generation with the smallest burden and best efficiency (usually to avoid probate or legal system).</li>\n</ol>\nNo matter where you are in your financial journey, we are available to answer your questions and get you on the path to financial wellness, now and in the future.\n\n<em>ProMedica Financial Opportunity Center (FOC) offers free financial coaching in a group and one-on-one setting to people of all zip codes and incomes.

    "Title": "Natural Ways to Ease Pregnancy Symptoms",
    "Content": "Pregnancy is an exciting time as you prepare to bring your bundle of joy into the world. Many women spend time during pregnancy “nesting” and getting the home and the nursery prepared for the new arrival. There are many exciting things to look forward to during pregnancy like baby showers and hearing that first heartbeat. Sometimes, pregnancy comes with unwanted physical symptoms, like nausea, fatigue, back pain, and swelling of the legs and feet. Here are some things to consider to ease your discomfort while preparing for baby.\n<h2>Keep Your Belly Happy</h2>\nOdd food cravings, being too hungry, and not being hungry are all common things women report they experience during pregnancy. Your body is supporting and helping baby to grow so nutrition is important. If low appetite is an issue, consider small meals. Eating a large meal may not be appealing during this time, so keeping snacks on hand may help you get the nutrition you need. In a hurry? Keep your purse, work bag, or car loaded with healthy quick snacks like trail mix, nuts, or dried fruit.\n\nHaving odd cravings like pickles on top of ice cream? Many women have cravings for all sorts of foods while pregnant. Many of these cravings are considered normal. If these cravings start to get more intense and your hunger level is up, you may want to check with your healthcare provider to make sure you’re getting enough nutrition and that your body isn’t lacking any vital nutrients.\n<h2>Tame the Nausea</h2>\nFeeling nauseous easily? Nausea is common for many pregnant women, especially during the first trimester. There are several things you can try to manage the nausea. Acupressure wrist bands are a safe, non-pharmaceutical and non-invasive way to help nausea symptoms. These bands have a small round bead on them that apply pressure to a specific point on the wrist. This pressure spot on the wrist can help calm the stomach for nausea due to pregnancy, travel/motion sickness, chemotherapy, etc. These bands can be worn for up to two days at a time. Apply these bands when you feel nauseous. Or, if you know your nausea is worse at a certain time of day, like the morning, apply them before bed to try to help make the morning nausea better.\n\nSipping on ginger tea or other ginger products like ginger chews can be helpful for some women with nausea. Ginger is warming in nature and this could help calm the stomach.  If sipping on something sounds like too much when you’re nauseous, how about smelling some mint? Mint essential oil has a calming, cooling scent. Taking in a few deep breaths of mint essential oil could calm your mind and calm your stomach.\n<h2>Rest Swollen Feet</h2>\nMild swelling of the feet and ankles happens to many women during pregnancy. Standing for long periods can make this worse. Try to take breaks from standing when possible. Putting your feet up throughout the day can help circulate fluid and reduce the appearance of swelling. Another great technique that could be helpful is dry brushing. Dry brushing involves using a body brush to lightly brush the skin from the feet up the legs. This can gently stimulate lymphatic flow and could help reduce swelling. And, as a bonus, it could help exfoliate dry skin, too!\n<h2>Relax an Aching Back</h2>\nBack pain is something that can occur or intensify in pregnancy, especially in the later stages. Gentle stretches throughout the day could help ease some muscle tension in the low back. Also, gentle exercise such as walking could be helpful. Exercise and stretching can be done safely during pregnancy, but make sure to check with your healthcare provider before beginning any new exercise routine.\n\nThere are many topical products available for muscle pain. These can contain many different ingredients and can be natural or contain small amounts of pharmaceuticals. Be sure to check the label before grabbing a topical to apply for back pain. For example, the ingredient methyl salicylate, found in several muscle pain topicals, is related to aspirin. In high amounts this ingredient may not be safe to use during pregnancy.\n<h2>Sleep for Fatigue</h2>\nThere a lot of demands on your body during pregnancy and your energy level can feel like it’s taking a hit. Fatigue affects many pregnant women during pregnancy and sometimes the fatigue may feel worse than other times. Taking short naps and resting when you can throughout the day can be helpful. Try to keep naps short so that it doesn’t interfere with your sleep at night. Also try not to over schedule yourself when possible. You may fatigue easier than you used to so try to say no to doing too much during the day.\n\nAlso, getting quality sleep at night could help your energy level during the day. Keeping a daily sleep routine of going to bed at the same time and waking at the same time may help. If you have trouble falling asleep, guided imagery or guided meditation focused on sleep can be helpful. These can help slow your mind down so that both body and mind are tired and ready to sleep. There are many apps available to download for guided imagery/meditation content.\n\nRemember that taking care of yourself is always important, especially when you’re pregnant. Talk with your healthcare provider if your side effects are affecting your daily life and overall health.\n\n<em>Be sure to contact your healthcare provider before trying any new natural product.

    "Title": "Getting Started With a Budget",
    "Content": "When most people think of health care, they tend to think of clinical and medical care. Yet this only accounts for 20% of a person's health and well-being. The other 80% is determined by the individual’s socioeconomic factors (40%), health behaviors (30%) and physical environment (10%).\n\nIt may seem difficult, or even impossible, to have a real impact on your socioeconomic status; but with a few changes and a little bit of planning, you can make important steps in building a healthier financial future. The ProMedica Financial Opportunity Center offers a few tips on how to get started with a budget.\n<h2>Set Financial Goals</h2>\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nThe first step to improving your finances is to set financial goals. Set short-term goals that you can achieve in less than a year, set intermediate goals that will take a year to achieve, and set long-term goals that will take two or more years to achieve.\n\nWhen goal setting, make sure that they are <em>SMART</em>!\n\n<strong>S</strong>pecific: State exactly what is to be done.\n<strong>M</strong>easurable: Include how the goal can be measured.\n<strong>A</strong>ttainable: Determine the steps to reach the goal.\n<strong>R</strong>ealistic: Do not set goals for something unrealistic.\n<strong>T</strong>ime-bound: State when the goal will be met.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/SMARTGoals_FNL.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft  wp-image-8589\" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/SMARTGoals_FNL.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"306\" height=\"306\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h2>Determine a Budget Method</h2>\nDecide how you are going to organize and prioritize your income and expenses. While there are many ways to do this, there are a few proven methods that others have found to work well. These include but are not limited to:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Zero-based budget</strong>: This type of budget accounts for all expenses, savings and debt payments so that they exactly equal your total monthly income, leaving zero dollars unaccounted for.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Envelope budget system</strong>: This budget system works by designating a separate envelope for each expense that you want to budget for (such as groceries, eating out, gas, etc.). When you get paid, place enough cash in each envelope to cover that expense. For example, if you expect to spend $400 on gas, place $400 cash in your gas envelope.</li>\n \t<li><strong>50/30/20 budget rule</strong>: This rule spreads your money across three buckets: needs, wants and savings/debt. Set 50% of your money for essential living, reserve 30% of your funds for expenses that are nice to have and use the last 20% of your income to start or build your savings or pay off debt. You can also change the percentages to fit your needs.</li>\n</ul>\nThese are just a few budget methods that you might consider using. The key is to find the method that works best for you. It’s OK to try one and if it doesn't work, try another until you find the right one.\n<h2>Create a Budget</h2>\nA written, monthly budget helps you plan how much you will spend and save each month. To make an effective budget, you will need to work with detailed and accurate information about your income and spending habits. Follow these steps to create a monthly budget:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Gather your financial records.</strong> Records may include bills, receipts, pay stubs, etc.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Calculate your income.</strong> Determine how much total money you can expect each month.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Create a list of monthly expenses.</strong> Write down all the expenses that you have throughout the month. This should include fixed bills, such as a car payment or mortgage, and variable expenses such as groceries and credit card bills.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Adjust your expenses.</strong> If you're in a situation where expenses are higher than income, look for places you can reduce your spending, like eating out less or canceling your gym membership.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Create a monthly budget and stick to the plan.</strong> Once you have set up a basic budget, customize it according to your financial situation and goals, and stick to the plan.</li>\n</ol>\nGet started on your journey to better financial health and well-being today!\n\n<em>ProMedica Financial Opportunity Center (FOC) offers free financial coaching in a group and one-on-one setting to people of all zip codes and incomes.

    "Title": "Preventing Summer Stings, Bites, Burns and Itchiness",
    "Content": "Summer is the perfect time to enjoy the great outdoors. Prevent stings, bites, burns and itchiness before they happen so that your time outside doesn’t get cut short.\n<h2>Things That Bite</h2>\n<h3>Mosquitoes</h3>\nMosquitoes are small flying insects that live just about everywhere in the world. Aside from being pesky and their bite causing an itchy bump, they can also carry diseases. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common mosquito-borne disease in the continental United States is West Nile virus (WNV). Symptoms of WNV may include fever, body aches, vomiting, diarrhea, inflammation of the brain and meningitis. Thankfully, 80% of people infected with the virus do not develop any symptoms.\n\nTo prevent mosquito bites and the diseases that come with them, wear long sleeves, pants and closed-toe shoes and insect repellant containing 20% to 30% DEET. Try purchasing mosquito-repellent plants or lighting a citronella candle near where you spend most of your time outside in the summer.\n<h3>Ticks</h3>\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nTicks, tiny arachnids that relate more to spiders than to mosquitos, are known for spreading diseases, which is what makes them such a concern. Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme Disease are just two of the serious diseases these blood-sucking species carry. Although only a small percent of ticks carry disease, it is still wise to use caution when outside to keep you, your family and even your pets safe.\n\nTicks hang out with their first pair of legs outstretched, often on tall blades of grass. When a host brushes by them, the tick climbs aboard. Therefore, the best method of tick prevention is to stay on trails and away from areas with tall grass. Wearing a tick repellent lotion or bug spray may also deter them. You may not feel the tick bite you, so always check yourself for ticks after a day outside, especially if you spent time off-trail or in tall grass.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8569 \" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/GettyImages-646199544-e1656448252370-300x289.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"289\" />\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h2>Things That Sting</h2>\n<h3>Bees, Wasps and Hornets</h3>\nMost bees, wasps and hornets are very beneficial to our environment. Whether they play the role of a pollinator, or they prey on “bad” insects that destroy crops, our earth wouldn’t be the same without them. However, that doesn’t make their stings hurt any less!\n\nTo lower your likelihood of getting stung, wear clean, light-colored clothing that covers as much of your body as possible, avoid perfumed toiletries and remain calm if a stinging inspect comes near you – swatting at it will only make it angry, and may cause it to sting. If you do get stung and experience more than redness and swelling at the sting site, such as difficulty breathing, seek emergency treatment immediately. You may be experiencing anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction).\n<h2>Things That Itch and Burn</h2>\n<h3>Poison Ivy, Poison Oak and Poison Sumac</h3>\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nPoison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac can cause itchy rashes because of an oil they contain called urushiol. Properly identifying these plants and avoidance is one of the best ways to avoid a potential reaction. Poison ivy or poison oak have red stems and leaves in groups of three arising from a single stem. Poison sumac may have five to seven or more leaves.  All species may have black dots on it from the urushiol oil that has been oxidized after exposure to oxygen.\n\nIf you come in contact with any of these plants, be sure to wash yourself and your clothes right away. Getting the urushiol off your skin is key to stopping the spread and calming the rash. You can also try applying an anti-itch or hydrocortisone cream, taking an oatmeal bath or using calamine lotion.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8563 size-medium\" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/Untitled-design-2022-06-28T152339.942-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h3>Wild Parsnip</h3>\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nIf your skin comes in contact with Wild Parsnip, it may become more sensitive to the sun’s UV rays. This may result in severe burns and blisters on the affected area of the skin.\n\nLearn to recognize Wild Parsnip and avoid it when in nature. The plant measures two to five feet tall, has yellow flowers when in bloom and its stem is hairless and grooved. Wear long sleeves and pants to decrease the surface area of skin that the oil comes in contact with. If you touch either plant, wash the affected area with soap and cold water as soon as possible and stay out of the sun.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8562 size-medium\" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/GettyImages-543589796-e1656447482226-300x292.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"292\" />\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\nMake the most of your summer by preventing bites, stings, burns and itchiness before they happen by staying on the trails, protecting your skin and seeking medical attention when it’s needed.",

    "Title": "Preventing Heat Exhaustion and Heatstroke in Kids",
    "Content": "Everyone is familiar with that extra-tired feeling after a long day of fun in the sun. A little extra tiredness is okay, but exhaustion from the heat can be dangerous. Eugene Izsak, MD, medical director of <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-russell-j-ebeid-childrens-hospital-emergency-center\">ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital - Emergency Center</a> shares the signs of heat exhaustion and heatstroke – conditions that children are even more susceptible to than adults.\n<h2>Heat-Related Illnesses</h2>\nOur bodies are built to get rid of excess heat from running around on a hot day – up to a certain point. When our bodies can no longer get rid of the excess heat and maintain a normal internal body temperature, we experience heatstroke. If not treated, heat stroke can be harmful, and even deadly.\n\nHeatstroke can be prevented in children by making sure that the child is drinking plenty of water and taking frequent breaks to cool off in the shade or air conditioning. Before heatstroke occurs, a person will experience heat exhaustion. Knowing the warning signs and taking quick action can prevent the condition and symptoms from progressing. If a child is experiencing any of the following symptoms, they may be experiencing heat exhaustion:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Headache, dizziness or confusion.</li>\n \t<li>Lethargy and tiredness.</li>\n \t<li>Excessive thirst.</li>\n \t<li>Cramping in arms, legs and stomach.</li>\n</ul>\nHeat exhaustion can lead to heatstroke if action is not taken. If these symptoms begin to appear, take the child inside to rest, cool down and drink plenty of fluids. If symptoms do not improve or worsen, seek medical attention.\n<h2>Hot Car Safety</h2>\nAccording to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), over 900 children have died of heatstroke since 1998 because they were left or became trapped in a hot car. It doesn’t take long for a car to heat up to unbearable temperatures – it can happen in just 10 minutes. However, with the right knowledge and prevention methods, all hot car deaths are preventable.\n\nHere are safety tips:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Never leave a child alone in a car – even if it’s not hot out, the AC is on or the windows are down.</li>\n \t<li>Make a habit of checking the back seat of the car before exiting the vehicle. Place a personal item that you never leave the car without (like a purse, briefcase or left shoe) in the back seat as a reminder.</li>\n \t<li>Always keep car doors locked when the car is not in use, keep keys out of a child’s reach and teach kids that the car is not a place to play.</li>\n</ul>\nHeat-related injuries and deaths are often preventable. Know the signs and act before the child’s symptoms worsen.",

    "Title": "Swim Safety Tips for Families",
    "Content": "Swimming is a summer pastime that helps us enjoy the sunshine and stay physically active. It’s great for the whole family, as introducing kids to water early can build a life-long interest in this form of exercise. But water activities do come with some risks for swimmers of all ages. Here are some tips for keeping your family safe around the water.\n<h2>Keep Babies Safe</h2>\nTalk with your pediatrician about when your baby may be ready to swim before getting them into the water. Young babies cannot regulate body temperature and have developing immune systems, which puts them at risk for hypothermia and contracting diseases or infections from potentially unclean pool water.\n\nWhen your baby is ready to swim, be sure to protect them with a life jacket specially made for babies to offer full body and neck support. This ensures that your baby will not be fully submerged under water. Introduce your baby to water in short increments of time to see how they tolerate it. If they enjoy the water, slowly increase the amount of time spent in the water.\n<h2>Make Sure Kids Are Supervised</h2>\nMore than 90% of drowning incidents with children involve a lack of adult supervision, so play close attention when your child is in the pool, even if they can swim well. If a parent isn’t paying close attention, drowning can be easy to miss. There’s usually no splashing and flailing like you see in the movies. Within minutes, damage can occur to the brain as it is deprived of oxygen.\n\nIf you spot someone drowning, get them out of the water as quickly as possible and try to help reestablish breathing. Use hands-only CPR our mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and call 911.\n<h2>Know the Signs of Dry Drowning</h2>\nAfter a water incident, know that there could be a risk of dry drowning. This happens when the fluid that fills a person’s lungs comes from inside the body from inflammation as opposed to fluid from outside the body. This inflammatory reaction can happen to anyone after a water incident, but toddlers and young children tend to be more susceptible because they are more likely to be submerged underwater.\n\nCases of dry drowning typically happen within 6-12 hours of a water incident. Respiratory distress is the main thing to look out for. If you can see that your child is having difficulty breathing – the space between their ribs is standing out, their belly is moving in and out aggressively, their nose is flaring in and out – it’s time to seek medical attention. Persistent coughing (especially that leads to vomiting) and tiredness or lack of interaction 2-3 hours after the incident are also signs.\n<h2>Keep the Water Clean</h2>\nKeeping swimming water as clean as possible is an important way to reduce the spread of germs and water illness. If you are sick or have been sick in the last two weeks with diarrhea and vomiting, stay out of the water. This includes all swimming water, pools, lakes and ponds.\n\nIt’s also important to keep urine and feces out of the water. Make sure that kids take swimming breaks frequently for bathroom breaks. Use swim diapers on babies, which are made to hold waste to keep the water clean and safe. (Just be sure to remove the swim diaper when the baby is out of the water, as they are not made to be absorbent.) Lastly, never swallow water that people swim in.\n<h2>Protect Your Ears</h2>\nSwimmer’s ear, or otisis externa, is usually caused by excessive water exposures. Water becomes trapped within the ear canal and the skin becomes soggy, which results in bacterial growth. Small cuts in the ear canal linings can also cause bacterial infection.\n\nIf you have swimmer’s ear, you may experience decreased hearing, jaw pain and facial swelling. You should see your primary care provider as this condition is best treated with antibiotic ear drops. Analgesics and topical heat may also help with the pain. For those with recurring swimmer’s ear, ear plugs while swimming may help reduce the risk. You may also consider using an ear drop solution made with one part rubbing alcohol and one part white vinegar before and after water exposure to prevent the condition.\n\nKeeping these safety precautions in mind can help you and your family safely enjoy water activities this summer.",

    "Title": "8 Things Men Can Do To Improve Their Health After 55",
    "Content": "Your quality of life depends largely on how well you take care of yourself. Follow these eight tips to help you thrive after 55!\n<h2>1. Protect your skin. ​</h2>\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/skin-cancer\">skin cancer</a> is the most common cancer in the United States. Furthermore, the CDC says that while we're all at risk for developing skin cancer, men are more at risk than women. To reduce your risk for skin cancer, wear sun-protective clothing (such as long sleeves, wide-brimmed hats and sunglasses), stay in the shade and apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher every two hours.\n<h2>2. Screen for prostate cancer.</h2>\nOne in six men will be diagnosed with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/prostate-cancer\">prostate cancer</a> during his lifetime. Many men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and without screening, would never know they had the disease. If you haven’t done so already, begin discussing the screening with your provider – it is recommended to begin screening for prostate cancer at age 40. Your doctor will help you decide when and how often to get tested based on personal risk factors.\n<h2>3. Take care of your heart.</h2>\nStay active, eat heart-healthy foods and get some rest! When done safely, exercise that raises your heart rate can support heart health. Diets low in sodium and void of fried, greasy foods help to keep your blood pressure low and arteries clear and healthy. Lastly, take time to relax and de-stress. Stress can result in high blood pressure, causing your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/heart-care\">heart</a> to have to work harder. Think about how you manage stress and brainstorm ways to keep your stress levels down.\n<h2>4. Check for diabetes.</h2>\nType 2 <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/diabetes\">diabetes</a>, also known as adult-onset diabetes, is a disease involving high blood-sugar levels. This disease increases your risk for heart disease, blindness, erectile dysfunction and nerve and kidney damage. Men age 50+ should be screened every three years for diabetes.\n<h2>5. Have routine colonoscopies.</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/colorectal-cancer\">Colorectal cancer</a> is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. But up to 90% of colon cancers could be prevented if people were screened at the appropriate times. Men with average risk should begin screening for colorectal cancer at age 50 and then have a colonoscopy every 10 years (the American Cancer Society recommends starting at 45 years). Colon cancer doesn’t always display symptoms and by the time symptoms appear, it’s harder to treat. Carly detection is your best bet.\n<h2>6. Know your mental health state.</h2>\nSurround yourself with people you love and participate in hobbies you enjoy to alleviate sadness or depression as you get older. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/depression\">Depression</a> may go undiagnosed, so talk to your doctor if you are experiencing unwanted thoughts or feelings.\n<h2>7. Exercise your brain.</h2>\nTo aid in the prevention of <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/alzheimers-and-dementia\">dementia or Alzheimer’s</a>, keep your brain active with mind workouts and crossword puzzles. Proper diet and physical exercise are additional ways to keep your brain healthy.\n<h2>8. Build your bones.</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/osteoporosis\">Osteoporosis</a> usually begins to affect men in their 60s and 70s. Combat brittle bones by eating a variety of calcium-rich foods, incorporating leafy greens into your diets and getting lots of vitamin D. Exercising and maintaining a healthy weight will also help keep your bones healthy.\n\nTalk to your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/\">doctor</a> about what screenings are recommended for you, ways to stay healthy or how to get your health back on track.",

    "Title": "Prioritize Your Health With a Well-Woman Exam",
    "Content": "Women, make your health a priority and take care of yourself today! One of the best ways to prioritize your health is simple – stay up to date on your annual wellness visits and exams, often called your well-woman exam.\n\nThis annual appointment starts at home, where patients can review their medical chart online and consider any specific topics they would like to discuss at their upcoming visit. When the patient arrives at the office, staff will check vital signs and inquire about any specific concerns the patient is hoping to address. The provider will ask questions about health history, and obstetric and gynecology history. All of that information is then used to guide what exam and screening tests are best suited for each individual. For example, many patients are surprised that the Pap test is often not required every single visit! After the exam, there is time for any questions or concerns.\n\nMany women feel nervous about scheduling preventive appointments. It helps to think of the providers as consultants. It is an opportunity to learn and consider their professional advice. Take the time to think about what was discussed and circle back later to create a plan without feeling pressured on the spot. For some, having an exam can be a sensitive matter. It is always reasonable to simply talk to the provider and return another time for a physical exam.\n\nA well-woman visit is custom to each individual. The patient’s health history and specific concerns drive the conversation of the appointment. The path to achieving and maintaining good health can look different for each person. Through puberty, motherhood, menopause and beyond, women need health care that addresses their bodies’ nuances and their lives. Let this serve as your reminder to be intentional and informed about your health.\n\n<em>Is it time for your well-woman exam? Schedule one with your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=17\">ProMedica OB/Gyn</a> today.</em>",

    "Title": "Improving Heart Health Among Women",
    "Content": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death among women in the United States. About one in five female deaths per year are directly related to heart disease. There is a common misconception that heart disease is a man’s disease. However, nearly just as many women die each year of heart disease in the United States.\n\nDespite these statistics, heart disease can be manageable by knowing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack, managing stress and maintaining a heart-healthy lifestyle.\n<h2>Heart Attack Symptoms Are Unique to Women</h2>\nWhen it comes to a heart attack, the most common symptom for both men and women is chest pain or pressure. However, there are lesser-known symptoms that women are more likely to experience. Back or jaw pain, new or profound fatigue, shortness of breath, new or profound indigestion, nausea and vomiting are all symptoms to look out for.\n\nSince heart attacks in women can have different and more subtle presentations than heart attacks in men, it is important to know the signs. If you believe you are having heart attack symptoms, it is important to seek immediate medical evaluation at the nearest emergency room by calling 911.\n<h2>Heart attack or panic attack?</h2>\nThere is an association between stress and heart disease. The relationship lies in the way that emotional stress can raise blood pressure. Many women are managing busy home and work lives, making them more susceptible to experiencing long-term stress, which increases the stress hormone in the body called Cortisol. Cortisol, in turn, affects the way the body controls blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nWith increased stress, the likelihood of having a panic attack also increases. Many panic attack and heart attack symptoms overlap and are often almost identical. Women who suffer from panic attacks usually refer to the pain at the center of their chest as stabbing in nature, but women who suffer from a heart attack usually describe it as heaviness or pressure. Overall, it can be hard for patients to differentiate between a panic attack and a heart attack.\n\nAs a general recommendation, anyone who feels a sudden onset of severe chest pain or discomfort, should immediately call 911 and seek emergency evaluation.\n<h2>Achieving a Heart-Healthy Lifestyle</h2>\nSome risk factors for heart disease, such as family history and genetics, are outside of your control. But there are still many things that can be done to keep your heart healthy.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Schedule your routine check-up. </strong>Scheduling an appointment with your primary care provider to help identify any potential heart issues and support your overall health is one easy way to help manage or reduce the risk of heart disease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat heart-healthy foods. </strong>Fruits, vegetables, nuts, lean meats, fish, whole grains and healthy oils are foods that help support your heart health. Limit red meat, packaged foods, and foods with lots of salt or sodium.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Find a physical activity you enjoy. </strong>You’re more likely to keep up with exercise when it’s something you enjoy doing. Aim to exercise for at least 30 minutes, three times a week, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Take steps to reduce stress. </strong>Managing busy home and work lives means women may be likely to experience long-term stress. Exercise, relaxation techniques and seeking professional help can help reduce and manage stress in healthy ways.</li>\n</ul>\nWhen making any lifestyle changes, it is important to remember that it is a marathon and not a sprint. Changes don’t happen overnight but making even one small, positive change can help reduce your risk of heart disease.\n\nKeeping your heart healthy will improve your quality of life, help you stay active as you age and can potentially even prolong your life. This year let’s take steps to maintain a heart-healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of heart disease because your heart is worth it!\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/mohammed-shuaib-md-cardiology\">Mohammed Shuaib, MD</a>, is a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians.</em>",

    "Title": "How to Enjoy More Meals as a Family",
    "Content": "Sharing a meal together is a great way for families to enjoy quality time, check in on each other and talk about what’s happening in each other’s lives. With busy schedules, it can be challenging. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/katelyn-oostra-md-pediatrics\">Katelyn Oostra, MD,</a> ProMedica Physicians Pediatrics, shares tips for families.\n\n“Just like exercise or other healthy habits, you have to make sharing a meal a priority. You have to choose to do it,” said Dr. Oostra. “Pick a small goal of when you’re going to do it, how long and what day of the week. Then, adjust the goal as needed.”\n\nWhen you’re starting out, don’t worry about being too structured. The shared meal doesn’t have to be every day, the same day each week or even dinnertime.\n\n“If you don’t currently eat together at the table, start by choosing one day. It doesn’t have to be dinner. It could be breakfast, lunch or even the snack everyone eats before sports practice,” explained Dr. Oostra. “Figure out what works for your family and what doesn’t.”\n\nThe earlier you start this family habit, the easier it will likely be. Young children may find it comforting, expected and find security in the stability. Teenagers may push back a bit on a new routine, wanting phones or TV while having their meal. Remember that it’s OK for them to communicate their feelings, but the parent or guardian sets the rules.\n\nBe flexible and find what works for you, including who is at the table.\n\n“It doesn’t have to necessarily be the whole family,” explained Dr. Oostra. “A family meal consists of two people part of the family – Mom, Dad, aunts, uncles, grandparents and cousins. It can be two family members sharing a meal.”\n\nCreating an opportunity for connection during mealtime is what is most important. Start small and work from there.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/katelyn-oostra-md-pediatrics\">Katelyn Oostra, MD</a>, is a pediatrician with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-oregon-pediatrics\">ProMedica Physicians Oregon Pediatrics</a>.\n</em>",

    "Title": "Understanding the Symptoms of Menopause",
    "Content": "Menopause is a term used to mark the end of a woman’s menstrual cycles. It’s a completely natural process, but taboo and confusion around the topic can make the experience harder for women. Understanding what happens in menopause, as well as common symptoms and treatments, can help you better support your body in midlife and beyond.\n\n“Many women don’t feel like they have good knowledge of menopause. We often spend so much time focusing on the reproductive years that menopause is pushed under the rug,” said <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/heather-wahl-md-facog-ncmp-gynecology\">Heather Wahl, MD, FACOG, NCMP</a>, a gynecologist with ProMedica Physicians Pelvic Health. “But every woman, if she lives long enough, is going to go through menopause. We need to change the way we view menopause, especially since most women will be spending a fair amount of time in it.”\n\nAs a certified menopause practitioner through The <a href=\"https://www.menopause.org/\">North American Menopause Society (NAMS),</a> Dr. Wahl has a special interest in helping women in menopause. It all starts with helping them understand what it actually is.\n<h2>What is menopause?</h2>\n“There is no test to date that can tell with certainty when a woman will go through menopause,” explained Dr. Wahl. “Menopause is defined as going 12 months without a menstrual period.”\n\nThe average age for menopause in the United States is 50-52 years old, but it can happen when a woman is in her 40s. The transition into menopause can be harder to spot for women who are actively using birth control. Specialists like Dr. Wahl may recommend stopping birth control use around 50 years of age to see what happens with the woman’s natural menstrual cycle.\n\nFor women who have had a hysterectomy, it can be helpful to check the woman’s hormones since they don’t have a regular period. Otherwise, hormone tests aren’t necessary as hormones can fluctuate so much from one month to another.\n<h2>What are the signs and symptoms of menopause?</h2>\nSome women may experience signs and symptoms in the months or years leading to menopause. This is called perimenopause. These symptoms may fluctuate and become more pronounced after menopause. Some women may not experience symptoms until menopause occurs.\n\nHere are some of the common signs of perimenopause and menopause:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Irregular periods:</strong> Extended intervals between menstrual cycles or more than one period per month.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Vasomotor symptoms:</strong> Hot flashes and night sweats, which may contribute to sleep problems.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Vaginal dryness:</strong> Loss of vaginal secretions, which may cause vaginal infections or painful sex.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Hair and nail changes:</strong> Thinning hair or hair loss.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Breast changes:</strong> Loss of breast fullness or enlargement of breasts.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Weight gain:</strong> Despite usual activity and diet.</li>\n</ul>\n“Women experiencing these symptoms need to be aware that until they go through menopause, they can still get pregnant,” said Dr. Wahl. “Until you are menopausal, it’s still possible.”\n<h2>What treatments help women cope with menopause symptoms?</h2>\nNot every woman has significant signs or symptoms during menopause. But there are treatments available when symptoms interfere with daily life. These treatments are individualized, based on a woman’s symptoms.\n<h3>Hormone Replacement Therapy</h3>\n“Hormone replacement therapy is designed to treat vasomotor symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats, and <em>only</em> vasomotor symptoms,” explained Dr. Wahl. “Not every patient will be a candidate and it’s meant for a limited time frame.”\n\nAlthough use in early menopause may have heart protective benefits, extended use and use after age 65 may increase risks for thrombotic events and dementia. Working with a certified menopause provider is key because they can discuss the risks and benefits, and make sure you’re on the lowest possible dose to relieve symptoms. They can also help you find the right type of hormone replacement therapy.\n\n“There are bioidentical FDA-approved hormone therapy options, which have the same hormones your body would naturally create,” explained Dr. Wahl. “Compounded hormone therapy is not recommended by the NAMS because they aren’t regulated, and doses may vary with each refill. They may also contain unnecessary additional hormones.”\n<h3>Pelvic Floor Physical Therapy and Topical Treatments</h3>\nFor women experiencing vaginal dryness due to the loss of estrogen, lubrication and vaginal moisturizers may be helpful. Lubrication is used during sex, while moisturizers are nonhormonal topicals that are used regularly (not during sex). For those with moderate to severe dryness, prescription options and hormonal options (e.g., vaginal estrogens) may be recommended.\n\nPelvic pain can sometimes be related to vaginal tissue changes, but sometimes the muscles themselves can be painful after menopause. Pelvic floor physical therapy can help improve the control, support and endurance of pelvic floor muscles to relieve pain and improve coordination.\n<h2>Where can I find more information about menopause?</h2>\nDr. Wahl recommends that women check out the <a href=\"https://www.menopause.org/for-women\">NAMS website</a> for resources and guides about menopause and its symptoms. You can also learn more about menopause and treatment on <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/menopause\">ProMedica’s website.</a>\n\nUnderstanding menopause can help make the transition less confusing and scary, so you know what to expect and what treatment options are available if needed.\n\n“We shouldn’t fear aging,” said Dr. Wahl. “You can and should enjoy aging.”",

    "Title": "How Tubs Can Ease Labor Pains for Expecting Mothers",
    "Content": "When you think of a bathtub, you may think of relaxation and serenity. That same idea holds true at hospitals that utilize tubs for mothers in labor.\n\nHospitals like <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-memorial-hospital\">ProMedica Memorial Hospital</a> in Fremont, Ohio, offer the birthing tub to mothers to provide a type of hydrotherapy during labor. Chelsea Ansted recently gave birth to her child and utilized the tub during the laboring process. “I was terrified of getting an epidural. I wanted to utilize all of my options and I loved the idea of the tub,” said Ansted.\n\nAccording to the <a href=\"https://americanpregnancy.org/healthy-pregnancy/labor-and-birth/water-births/\">American Pregnancy Association</a>, a water tub provides many benefits to patients, including helping with comfort and relaxation, lowering high blood pressure caused by anxiety, and reducing stress-related hormones.\n\nThe hospital’s birthing tub is designed to assist in the labor process, but not the actual birthing process, according to Tracy L. Bartson, certified nurse midwife, ProMedica Physicians Obstetrics Gynecology in Fremont. When it comes time to push, the patient will come out of the tub to deliver the baby. “About 6% of U.S. women will use birthing tubs as part of their birthing plan,” said Bartson.\n\nBefore delivering her baby, Ansted spent nearly two hours in the tub, which she described as similar to stepping into a Jacuzzi. “There was a bench to sit down on and there was room for me to stretch out. It wasn’t too hot and it wasn’t too cold, and was very easy to move around in,” she said.\n\nCathy D. Dull, manager of labor and delivery at ProMedica Memorial Hospital, said the tub is larger than what is typically found in a person's bathroom, with openings on three sides that allows staff to care for patients safely. The tub includes grab bars, microban and a thermal air system to keep the water the same temperature and to sanitize it.\n\n“It was ultimately one of the best experiences,” says Ansted, about utilizing the tub during her labor. “I can’t stop ranting and raving about the staff at Memorial Hospital. They are amazing and we love every single one of them,” she adds.\n\n<em>For more information about maternity services, please visit <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/maternity\">ProMedica's website.</a></em>",

    "Content": "February: the month of “Where did January go?”. In this shortest month, we’ll decorate with hearts for Valentine’s Day, celebrate American Heart Month and prep for Spring (since we are all done with being cold!). As a therapist and dietitian, I’d like to take a minute to talk about getting more in tune with “loving” our bodies, inside and out. Here are some of my favorite tips!\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Listen to your body, especially when you’re hungry.</strong> Hunger isn’t something that needs to be ignored. Your body is letting you know that it needs energy to do all of the amazing things it can do like move, breathe and think!</li>\n \t<li><strong>Change what you are telling yourself about your body.</strong> Think of what you love about it and all it does for you. Our minds are very powerful. If we are constantly sending negative messages to our bodies and how “imperfect” they are, it makes it difficult to celebrate how wonderful it is!</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat foods that lift you up and increase your energy</strong> like fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats, foods with probiotics like yogurt or kefir, whole grain breads and beans.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Be YOU!</strong> Avoid comparing yourself to everyone around you. We are all made to be unique and special. Celebrate the uniqueness that is YOU!</li>\n \t<li><strong>Review your social media feeds.</strong> Are they in line with the “thinking” you want to promote? If you fill your mind with uplifting quotes, stories and information, you will feel much less overwhelmed and defeated. Think about what makes you feel happy. Spend more time nourishing that side of social media instead of the negative messages!</li>\n \t<li><strong>Plan an activity to look forward to</strong> – a trip with friends, a girl’s or guy’s night out, a special date with your special someone, a vacation with family or something even quicker like time at the animal shelter, lunch with a friend, or an uninterrupted hour reading your favorite book.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Evaluate how you spend your time.</strong> Are you allowing “free time” or “down time” to rest and relax?</li>\n \t<li><strong>Take a minute to think about how much sleep you are getting.</strong> Our perspective is always a bit more negative and clouded when we aren’t getting enough rest.</li>\n</ol>\nFebruary is a great month to start thinking about each of these suggestions and putting them into practice. Start with one thing and add in more as you are able. Life is a journey, take the time to enjoy it and love your body again.\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "The Importance of Cervical Cancer Screenings",
    "Content": "Annual well woman visits are an important part of prevention and overall health. They help detect and sometimes prevent health conditions, such as cervical cancer.\n\n“Cervical cancer is totally preventable,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/courtney-payne-pa-c-if-gynecology-oncology#primaryLocation\">Courtney Payne, PA-C, IF,</a> a certified physician assistant with ProMedica Physicians Gynecology Oncology. “As long as we stay on top of routine screenings where a provider can assure that the cervix looks normal and catch abnormalities ahead of time, we can make sure it’s caught really early and sometimes fix those changes, such as precancer, before it turns into cancer.”\n<h2>Understanding Pap Tests and HPV Tests</h2>\nLike other cancers, cervical cancer develops when abnormal or damaged cells continue to grow and multiply. Gynecological exams help to catch these abnormalities early, sometimes before cancer even develops.\n\nA Pap test collects sample cells from the cervix, which are then sent to the lab to check for abnormalities. A Human papillomavirus (HPV) test screens for HPV, a sexually transmitted infection that might lead to cervical cancer. Few women with HPV get cervical cancer, but nearly all cervical cancer is caused by this virus.\n\nNot sure which test is right for you? The <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/cervical-cancer-screening\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a> recommends the following screenings guidelines:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Under 21: No screening.</li>\n \t<li>21-29 years old: Pap test every 3 years.</li>\n \t<li>30-65: Pap test every 3 years OR HPV test every 5 years OR combined Pap test and HPV test every 5 years.</li>\n \t<li>65+ No screening following prior adequate screening.</li>\n</ul>\nWhen it comes to screening, the most important thing is talking with your healthcare provider to make sure your screenings are up to date.\n\n“Unfortunately, we’re seeing that a lot of ladies are putting off their routine screenings, whether that’s a physical exam, a Pap test, mammograms or colonoscopies,” says Payne. “We’re getting in this mode where we feel we need to stay home more often and we’re putting off office visits. Medical professionals are really trying to encourage people to have those routine screenings because they can be preventive and help eliminate things like cervical cancer.”\n<h2>Protecting Your Cervical Health</h2>\nIn addition to annual visits and regular cervical cancer screenings, Payne recommends talking with your doctor about the HPV vaccination.\n\nShe explains, “The vaccine helps to prevent the HPV virus, which causes most cervix cancers. Up to 90-95% of cervix cancers are HPV driven. If we can vaccinate against that virus, it can really eliminate or reduce the chance of that virus causing problems down the road.”\n\nWhen cervical cancer is found early, the chances for recovery are high. Screenings are especially important because cervical cancer may not always cause symptoms, especially in the beginning stages. Some women may experience pelvic pain, pain with intercourse, abnormal bleeding, or bleeding with intercourse. In advanced cases, women may notice urinary or bowel movement changes, shortness of breath, or swelling.\n\nIf you can’t remember when your last pelvic exam or Pap test was, check in with your OB/Gyn.\n\n“As uncomfortable as the exam may be, it is absolutely necessary,” says Payne. “Especially as cervical cancer is a cancer we can prevent, taking a few minutes to take care of yourself is so important.”\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/yourhealth/cervicalhealth\">Learn more about cervical cancer screenings.</a>",

    "Title": "Recognizing Depression in Children",
    "Content": "Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between someone who's just sad, and a person who is depressed. Kids are no exception. There could be numerous reasons why your child isn't acting like their typical self. Issues at school, arguments with friends and even a more serious family loss could all be factors in your child's recent behavior. While talking out your child's issues one-on-one is a good place to start, another factor to consider is whether or not your child is depressed.\n\nClinical depression is one of the most commonly diagnosed mental health disorders in children. Children with depression experience many of the same symptoms as adults. However, because depressed children are more likely to suffer from low self-esteem, anger and anxiety, local experts stress the importance of early diagnosis.\n\n“Within the past couple of years, depression in children and adolescents has risen significantly, most likely in conjunction with the COVID-19 pandemic,” explains <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jon-r-dvorak-md-pediatrics\">Jon Dvorak, MD</a>. “Your primary care provider can help diagnose depression through parent/patient/practitioner communication and use of depression questionnaires, as well as treating and referring out for further psychiatric care.”\n\nSymptoms of depression vary by person, but here are a few warning signs:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Persistent sadness.</li>\n \t<li>Inability to enjoy or loss of interest in favorite activities.</li>\n \t<li>Increased activity or irritability.</li>\n \t<li>Frequent complaints of physical illnesses, such as headaches or stomach aches.</li>\n \t<li>Frequent absences or poor performance in school.</li>\n \t<li>Persistent boredom, feeling hopeless, low energy, or poor concentration.</li>\n \t<li>Major changes in eating or sleeping patterns.</li>\n \t<li>Alcohol or substance abuse.</li>\n \t<li>Failure to thrive.</li>\n \t<li>Thoughts about death or suicide.</li>\n</ul>\nWhile these warning signs are severe, you can take comfort knowing that help is just a phone call away. If you believe your child may be depressed, contact your child’s doctor as soon as possible.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"#\"] Find a ProMedica pediatrician.

    "Title": "Keeping Your Family Healthy This Holiday Season",
    "Content": "As we approach the holiday season, it is important for us to appreciate our health and the health of our loved ones. Hopefully, these recommendations will keep you and yours healthy as we look forward to 2022.\n<h2>Stay active with routine exercise.</h2>\nCommitting to exercise can be challenging during the holiday season, but remember, the more you exercise, the more energy you will have. Make a goal of at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week. Any activity that results in sustained elevation of your heart rate and breathing is acceptable. You can do 30 minutes 5 days per week or break it up into no less than 10-minute increments throughout the day. Exercise options include walking, biking, or swimming. You can also find exercise videos on YouTube, dance to your favorite songs, or exercise with friends via Zoom. If you are elderly or have chronic medical conditions, first consult with your doctor before starting to exercise. However you choose to move, make a plan and schedule it into your day.\n<h2>Stick to a healthy diet and enjoy treats in moderation.</h2>\nTemptation lurks around every corner with delicious holiday dishes and tasty treats this time of year. Just remember, moderation is key. When attending holiday potlucks and parties, use a small plate to reduce portions and resist going back for seconds. When preparing meals, focus on increasing your intake of fruits and vegetables. Fresh is best; however, fresh fruits and vegetables may be hard to find when out of season. Frozen and canned items are acceptable alternatives if you select fruits in their own juices (not heavy syrup) and low-sodium/no salt added vegetables. Also include whole grains and beans followed by lean meats. Limit your intake of saturated and trans fats found in margarine, butter, shortening, gravies, sauces, pastries, dairy, red meat, and fried foods. Likewise, limit your intake of sodium found in processed meats, pre-packaged items, and salty snacks. Lastly, remember to drink enough water, avoid sweetened beverages, and limit your alcohol consumption.\n<h2>Recognize and reduce stress.</h2>\nFor some, the holiday season is not always the most wonderful time of the year. Some people struggle with loss, grief, and isolation. Be sure to appropriately address these emotions by talking and sharing with others and seeking professional help if needed.\n\nAvoid adding to your stress by overcommitting to social obligations. Do not be afraid to say no. Also, start early with shopping, cooking, or planning an event to avoid the last-minute rush. Formulate a plan and set goals to keep yourself on track. Good sleep is also important for reducing stress. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day (even holidays!) and sleep in a quiet, dark room without the distraction of a phone, tablet, or TV.\n<h2>Protect yourself and others from COVID-19.</h2>\nTransmission rates for COVID-19 are still high in most of the country including Ohio, and the Delta variant is very contagious. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing a face mask inside indoor public areas and avoiding large crowds. Everyone 2 years of age and older should wear a well-fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth. Use caution in restaurants, shopping centers, and places that are not well ventilated. Before you travel, check the transmission rates and local requirements of your destination.\n\nBe careful when visiting family, especially the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Even if vaccinated, they could still be at risk for contracting the illness. If you are sick, stay home. COVID-19 symptoms can overlap with symptoms of allergies, the common cold, and sinus infections. It is important to contact your provider and get tested if you have symptoms. Even if you test negative for COVID-19, continue to wear a mask and avoid exposure to others while ill to reduce the risk of spreading other germs.\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and are the best way to help keep you, your family, friends, and loved ones safe during the holiday season. Learn more about the vaccines at www.CDC.gov or talk with your doctor. For increased protection, get a COVID-19 booster shot if eligible. The annual flu vaccine is also an important way to help prevent the transmission of disease during flu season.\n\nThis holiday season, remember the importance of your health and well-being. Let’s end the year on a healthy note!",

    "Title": "Improving Your Posture for Better Spine Health",
    "Content": "Having good posture is so much more than sitting up straight or not slouching. According to Robin Dean, PT, OMPT, ProMedica Total Rehab, posture involves the entire body, and includes how you stand and move. Understanding how to better support your movement with good posture may help prevent pain and injury.\n<h2>Recognizing Bad Posture</h2>\nSome common practices may have detrimental effects on your posture and spine. This includes sitting slouched at your workstation or while driving in a car, prolonged standing or looking down at a phone or tablet for too long.\n\nDean also says repeated lifting, twisting or bending, sleeping on your stomach and self-cracking your neck are a few other things that could negatively impact your posture.\n<h2>Standing, Sitting and Moving Properly</h2>\nThe way you sit, stand and move all impact your posture. Dean says when you stand, you want to equally distribute your weight between both legs, feet pointing forward and shoulder width apart, unlock your knees, pull your navel in toward your spine and squeeze your buttocks together.\n\n“You want to lengthen your spine in this position too,” says Dean. “Keep the back of your neck tall with shoulders back and breast bone up. I like to educate my patients to ‘suck and tuck, breast bone up’ to protect their spine in the standing position.”\n\nDean says it’s important to engage your abdominal muscles and gluteals during prolonged standing to protect your lower lumbar from sway back (hyperlordosis) and compression of the posterior structures. Dean utilizes Movement Re-Education with her spine patients to retrain their movement patterns. If the patient’s pain is eliminated and then they go back to their old movement patterns, the pain will likely return.\n\nAdditionally, Dean uses hip hinge techniques that strengthen the spine and replace the bending and twisting that cause structural damage to discs when repeated over time.\n<h2>Practicing Better Posture at Work</h2>\nNeutral spine positions can be found when sitting, standing and sleeping. When at your workstation, ergonomics (the study of people’s efficiency in the work environment) suggest sitting with your back against the lumbar support of your chair. Dean recommends adjustable chairs so you may customize them to your body size.\n\n“Do not slide forward or sit on the edge of your chair,” says Dean. “Make sure your hips and knees are at 90 degrees and your feet are flat on the floor. Use the arm rests to support and decrease strain on your joints.”\n\nDean also says to make sure your computer monitor is at eye level and directly in front of you to avoid twisting or prolonged flexion or extension in your spine. In addition, it’s helpful to keep the items you use most close to you at your desk so you’re not repeatedly reaching and twisting at your workstation.\n\n“I like to educate patients to sit tall and imagine a string pulling the back of their head and spine up into a lengthened position,” says Dean.\n<h2>Texting, Bone Cracking and Other Bad Habits</h2>\nAnother really important issue comes from what Dean calls “Text Neck.” Many people look down at their phones and tablets for much of the day, which puts immense strain on the spine. In the neutral spine lengthened position, you have 10 to 12 pounds of pressure going through your spine. When you look down at your phone at 60 degrees of flexion, you have 60 pounds of pressure going through your spine.\n\nDean also discourages self-cracking of your cervical or lumbar spine. Though it can cause temporary relief early on, it could contribute to segmental instability, disc degeneration and more pain through micro tears and micro trauma.\n\n“Spine protection is important to lessen the structural breakdown to the mechanical integrity of the discs that we all get as we age,” says Dean.\n\nPoor posture can also contribute to detrimental spine health issues. In addition to spinal dysfunction and joint degeneration, some people experience pain that radiates into the extremities, numbness and tingling that extends to fingers and toes, a weakened core and even headaches.\n<h2>Getting Started with a Physical Therapist</h2>\nGood posture is one way to help prevent potential pain. The first step to improvement comes with being aware when you’re not in a good position. A physical therapist can develop an exercise plan to correct your muscle imbalance and get you into a balanced posture.\n\n“ProMedica Total Rehab physical therapists utilize evidence-based stabilization exercises and manual therapy to improve posture, movement patterns, strength, flexibility and function,” says Dean.\n\nDean suggests not waiting until you experience severe symptoms to seek help. “A physical therapist can give you the tools to restore your posture and function and avoid long-term dysfunction, joint degeneration or even surgery.”\n\nThough Dean knows these changes are a lot to consciously think about all the time, she encourages people to do their best to take care of their spine through posture correction.\n\n“You only get one spine, so strengthen it and protect it with good posture, correct ergonomics and proper movement patterns,” says Dean. “There is no such thing as a spine replacement.”\n\n<em>Learn more about rehabilitation and physical therapy on </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/rehabilitation-and-therapy\"><em>ProMedica's website.</em></a>",

These include but are not limited to difficulty breathing, any uncontrolled bleeding or a change in the color of their skin, lips or tongue (especially blue or extremely pale). If your child is unresponsive or showing signs of a seizure, emergency care is needed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Monitor the Fever</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s important that you know how to take and monitor your child’s temperature. Skin scanners and ear/tympanic thermometers work well, but it’s a good idea to take three readings to make sure you are getting readings that are close together to assure an accurate temperature.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">A child has a fever if there’s a reading over 100.5F. Children generally have higher temperatures than adults because their immune systems are gaining exposure and building strength against many common viruses that adults have already been exposed to. Fever is our friend! It fires up our child’s immune system to help it conquer viruses and other infections. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Children generally do not run fevers high enough to hurt themselves unless it’s a very serious infection. In these cases, the child’s behavior will usually indicate before their temperature does that they need immediate care. They will act confused, inconsolable or unresponsive. Temperatures over 105F generally indicate a serious infection of this nature.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Use Medicine When Needed</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Not every fever requires treatment with medication. If your child is happy, drinking well, playful and sleeping well, no treatment is required. But if your child is uncomfortable because of their fever, medication may be used if they have not had any in the recent past. Acetaminophen is available in liquid form, and can be given every 4 hours as needed for fever. Children over 6 months of age can receive ibuprofen. It is also available in liquid form and can be given every 6 hours as needed for fever. It is important to have an acetaminophen/ibuprofen dosing chart available in your home so you can determine how much medication your child can safely receive based on their current weight. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Medications to reduce fever will start to work in 30-60 minutes, so wait one hour to recheck your child’s temperature. The medication is a success if it decreases the temperature by a degree or degree and one half. So if a child started at 102F and after one hour of giving acetaminophen they are 101F, then the medicine has succeeded! If after an hour the child is still miserable and crying uncontrollable, then it would be a good idea to call their primary care provider for more specific advice on how to care for your child.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2 aria-level=\"2\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Avoid Tepid or Alcohol Baths</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tepid and alcohol baths have been used in the past to decrease a fever, but they are not recommended today. Alcohol baths can actually be fatal. The child absorbs the alcohol through their skin and this can cause fetal alcohol toxicity. So they should never be used as a tactic to reduce a fever.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Tepid baths may sound like a good idea to cool of your child when they are so hot, but they don’t work as you think. When you apply tepid water or put a child in a tepid bath, this causes them to shiver. The cooler water alerts the body that they need to raise the temperature, and causes the body to shiver to produce heat. This then will actually raise the child’s temperature. This is not what we want!

    "Title": "Recognizing and Treating Ear Infections in Children",
    "Content": "Parents of young children are no stranger to sickness, especially when it comes to ear infections. According to the <a href=\"https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/ear-infections-children\">National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders,</a> ear infections are the most common reason parents bring their child to a doctor.\n\nWhen it comes to babies, parents need to have an eagle eye to be sure to catch the often subtle signs their little ones may be sick. Ear infection symptoms include pulling on the ear, irritability, decreased appetite, fever, nausea and vomiting, and sleep changes.\n\n“Any concern parents have should be followed up,” said <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/stephanie-cole-md-otolaryngology-ear-nose-throat\">Stephanie Cole, MD</a>, an otolaryngologist with ProMedica Physicians Ear, Nose and Throat. “If they think their child is not acting the way he or she usually does, follow your instinct about it.”\n<h2>What is an ear infection?</h2>\nAn ear infection is a bacterial or viral infection in the middle ear – the space behind the eardrum. They can occur when viral or respiratory illnesses cause swelling, mucus and inflammation that blocks the Eustachian tubes – the tubes that connect the middle ear to the back of the throat. When the tubes are blocked, fluid cannot drain from the ear and air pressure is not regulated. In babies, the tubes are narrower and more horizontal, making them more difficult to drain and more likely to get clogged.\n\n“There really isn’t a good way to prevent ear infections,” said Dr. Cole. “The key thing is keeping the nose healthy so we can keep the ears healthy, too.”\n\nTo help reduce your child’s risk of developing an ear infection, prevent common colds and other illnesses by minimizing your child’s exposure to sick people and washing your hands frequently. Avoid secondhand smoke by staying in smoke-free environments. Breastfeeding for at least six months may reduce the risk of ear infections. If you bottle-feed your child, hold the baby in an upright position. Make sure childhood immunizations are up to date.\n<h2>How are ear infections treated?</h2>\nThere are several treatment options for ear infections. Sometimes, doing nothing is the best course of action.\n\n“Studies show that ear infections can resolve over time – when we allow the upper respiratory issue to resolve, the ear infection may go away,” said Dr. Cole.\n\nAntibiotics are typically given when there are acute symptoms such as fever, pain and hearing loss associated with the fluid behind the ear drums.\n\nIf a child has six infections in one year, four infections in six months, persistent fluid over three months, hearing loss or other complications from ear infections, ear tubes may be needed. During an outpatient surgical procedure, surgeons make a small incision in the ear drum, drain any built-up fluid, and insert a tube. The tubes stay in place for six months to a year and usually fall out on their own.\n\n“The tubes allow the pressure in the middle ear to equalize and fluid to drain from the middle ear so it doesn’t build up and cause infections,” said Dr. Cole. “They also provide a route to deliver antibiotics, if needed.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/stephanie-cole-md-otolaryngology-ear-nose-throat\">Stephanie Cole, MD</a> is an otolaryngologist with ProMedica Physicians Ear, Nose and Throat. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/ear-nose-and-throat\">Learn more</a> about ear, nose and throat conditions. </em>",

    "Content": "<span data-contrast=\"auto\">According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. The average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. There are more than 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">While it is important to wear pink and support our loved ones affected by breast cancer, it is even more important to make sure common myths are dispelled. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2>MYTH: If I don’t have a family history of breast cancer, I won’t get it.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FACT:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Even if patients do not have a family history of breast cancer, or do not have a known genetic mutation that predisposes them to breast cancer, it does not mean that they will definitely not develop breast cancer at some point in their lives.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">The majority of patients diagnosed with breast cancer do not have a family history that can account for their disease. Only approximately five to 10% of patients with breast cancer have a known genetic mutation that has predisposed them to develop the disease. When faced with a new diagnosis, doctors previously used family history to determine whether a patient would benefit from genetic testing to potentially diagnose a mutation that could be responsible for their development of cancer. Currently, the American Society of Breast Surgeons recommends that all patients with a new diagnosis of breast cancer be offered genetic counseling and potentially, testing.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2>MYTH: If you maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, and limit alcohol, you don’t have to worry about breast cancer.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FACT:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> While maintenance of a healthy weight, regular exercise, and limiting alcohol are important steps that can be taken to reduce the overall risk of breast cancer, they can not guarantee that a person will not develop cancer. Most breast cancers are “sporadic” and “multifactorial,” meaning that a patient may or may not have a predisposition to developing cancer and may have been exposed to a lifestyle or environmental factor that has caused the malignant transformation of normal cells.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2>MYTH: Wearing a bra can cause breast cancer.</h2>\n<b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FACT:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Underwire bras can contain metal, which can lead to concern that they increase the risk of cancer. There is no evidence that any type of bra, with or without an underwire, has any impact on the risk of or development of breast cancer.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2>MYTH: Using underarm antiperspirant can cause breast cancer.<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h2>\n<b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FACT:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Because underarm deodorants and antiperspirants are applied in close proximity to the breast and can potentially contain harmful ingredients, there has long been concern regarding their contribution to the development of breast cancer or increase in breast cancer risk. This has been refuted by multiple scientific studies that have failed to prove a link between deodorant/antiperspirant and breast cancer. Aluminum is the ingredient that is most commonly cited as a possible carcinogen, yet it has not been proven to lead to an increased risk of breast cancer in current studies.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2>MYTH: Breast cancer always causes a lump you can feel.</h2>\n<b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FACT: </span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Most women diagnosed with a new breast cancer do not have any palpable findings on their self-breast examination or clinical breast examination. These cancers are most often detected on an annual screening mammogram, even when the woman has had a normal mammogram the year prior.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">A smaller percentage of patients present to their physicians for evaluation after feeling a mass or lump in their breast and are subsequently diagnosed with breast cancer. Some of these patients will have had normal mammography within the past year. These patients typically, but not always, have a more aggressive type of cancer.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n<h2>MYTH: All breast cancer is treated pretty much the same way.</h2>\n<b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">FACT:</span></b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> “Tumor biology” (type of cancer cells, types of receptors and proteins present on breast cancer cells), tumor size, clinical stage, and patient factors determine the recommended treatment for breast cancer. There are many “types” of breast cancer, which vary widely with regard to treatment recommendations. No two patients have identical experiences, although there may be similarities in their treatments. Treatment plans can only be formulated once a patient has been evaluated by a breast cancer surgeon and medical oncologist, as well as a radiation oncologist, in many situations.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Dispelling these myths is essential in making breast cancer awareness important every day of the year. One of the most important choices you can make is to have preventative screenings - be sure to talk with your physician about the best screening schedule for you.</span>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Learn more about protecting your breast health with a mammogram.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/yourhealth/breasthealth/\"] Learn About Mammograms [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "6 Things That May Improve Your Chances for Having a Baby",
    "Content": "You’ve checked out car seats, made plans for a nursery and even put together a list of potential names. You’re planning to get pregnant and excited that a baby could soon be on the way. So, where should you start? <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/rosie-li-md-obstetrics\">Rosie Li, MD,</a> an obstetrician and gynecologist with ProMedica Physicians, shares simple tips that may improve your chances for successfully conceiving and having a healthy baby.\n<h2>1. Make your health a priority.</h2>\nTaking good care of yourself now will help you take good care of your baby. Here are a few ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Ask your doctor about your medications.</strong> Certain medications can affect your ability to become pregnant. And some, including specific drugs for blood pressure, seizures and mood disorders, may be harmful for a developing baby. While you should never stop your medications on your own, it’s important to have a conversation about your medicines with your healthcare provider.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Control chronic conditions.</strong> When both parents are in good health, conception is more likely. This means if you have a chronic medical condition like diabetes or high blood pressure, it’s best to make sure it’s well controlled.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Reach a healthy weight.</strong> If you’re seriously overweight, losing weight may help you conceive. Shedding pounds may also lower your risk of pregnancy complications, although losing weight isn’t usually recommended once you become pregnant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Lead a healthy lifestyle.</h2>\nThere are many aspects of a healthy lifestyle, and when planning to conceive, it’s important to consider them all:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Eat a balanced diet. </strong>Aim for meals consisting of nutritious foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, proteins and dairy products. And try to limit empty calories, like sweets.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get regular exercise. </strong>Regular physical activity that raises your heart rate offers many benefits. The best activities are those you enjoy and will stick to, preferably daily. Walking, for example, is a really good exercise for your muscles and something that’s sustainable before, during and after pregnancy. At a minimum, Dr. Li recommends 30 minutes of activity at least three times a week.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Limit alcohol. </strong>While drinking alcohol on occasion is okay, if you drink daily, cutting back may help you conceive. And, of course, once you become pregnant, we recommend not drinking alcohol at all.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stop smoking. </strong>If you smoke, it’s best to kick your tobacco habit since nicotine can decrease fertility. Stopping smoking can definitely increase your chances of conceiving.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3. Take a prenatal vitamin.<strong>\n</strong></h2>\nDr. Li recommends that all women of reproductive age start on a prenatal vitamin, which provides important nutrients, including folic acid to help prevent certain birth defects. They offer benefits beyond that, as well. For example, there are studies that show taking a prenatal vitamin can increase your chances of conception, and at the same time, help with first trimester sickness once you are pregnant.\n\nAccording to Dr. Li, the greatest benefits occur in women who have taken the vitamins three to four months before conception.\n<h2>4. Manage your stress.</h2>\nIt’s true that stress is a normal part of life, but it can interfere with your ability to get pregnant. When your body is stressed, it can produce stress hormones, and those hormones can potentially alter the frequency of your periods. Getting regular exercise, sleeping at least eight hours each night and talking to a counselor can all be effective strategies for managing stress.\n<h2>5. Track your cycles.</h2>\nSince you’re most fertile five days before ovulation and two days after, it’s important to track your cycles. And if you aren’t the paper calendar type, there are many apps to help you identify your fertile window based on your previous periods. Find them by searching “menstrual tracking” on the internet or in your app store.\n<h2>6. Talk with your doctor early and often.</h2>\nPeople usually don’t think about working with an OB-GYN until after they become pregnant. But OB-GYNs can be a tremendous resource when you’re trying to conceive. There’s science behind pregnancy, and OB-GYNs are experts in that science.\n\nYou should also seek medical advice if you’re having trouble conceiving. Dr. Li recommends:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>If you’re having regular periods and are younger than 35 years old,</strong> seek help after a year of trying to get pregnant.</li>\n \t<li><strong>If you’re older than 35,</strong> seek help after six months.</li>\n</ul>\nOften, doctors can identify causes for infertility, and once treated, pregnancy is more probable. But even if no cause is found, you shouldn’t be discouraged. If you want to grow your family there are many options to help you conceive, such as in vitro fertilization.\n\n“Reach out if you have any questions,” says Dr. Li. “We’re always here to help.”\n\n<em>Learn more about </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/maternity\"><em>maternity services at ProMedica</em></a><em>.</em>",

    "Title": "Staying Calm When Your Toddler’s in the ER",
    "Content": "It’s impossible to prepare for everything as a parent. But sometimes, thinking through hypothetical situations can help you feel more prepared if something were to happen. If your toddler had to go to the emergency room, how would you remain calm? Here are a few tips for how to respond as a parent when you’re in the emergency room with your child.\n<h2>The Scenario: An IV Is Needed for Dehydration</h2>\nImagine that your 3-year-old child has been sent by your provider to the emergency room for treatment of dehydration. The nurse is coming into their room to start an IV.  When your child sees the nurse, they get anxious and look to you. How do you respond?\n<ol>\n \t<li>Cry as the child receives the IV.</li>\n \t<li>Tell the child the mean nurse will be done soon.</li>\n \t<li>Say, “It's ok, it's ok” over and over while nervously pulling your child into your lap.</li>\n \t<li>Smile at your child and touch them in a comforting way.</li>\n</ol>\nNow, you may think that this scenario is over-dramatized, but as a provider for over 20 years, I can tell you that all four of these responses are common!\n\nBeing in an unfamiliar setting and worrying about your child and their medical condition can certainly be upsetting. But in this scenario, it’s very important to remember that your child is watching you, and can sense your emotions. It’s really important to take your own emotional inventory and be able to keep any anxiety or distress in check.\n<h3>Compose Yourself, If Needed</h3>\nIf you really can’t stop yourself from crying, it’s probably best to leave the bedside for a few minutes, get those tears out and then come back being able to support your child.\n<h3>Focus on Your Child</h3>\nIn this scenario, your child is looking to you for emotional guidance- how upset or worried should I be?  Be calm, try to express confidence and focus on how to help your child. This will keep you in “parenting mode” to be able to appropriately support your child. Your own emotional distress will spill over to your child if you let it, and make a very challenging situation for them even worse.\n<h3>Express Confidence</h3>\nExpress confidence to your child and reassure them. Tell them that they will be OK and can handle whatever happens. Children’s strength in these situations is surprising to many parents!\n\nWhen your child needs emergency care, it can be very upsetting. Being prepared and focusing on being a support to your child can go a long way to making a challenging situation easier.\n\n<em>Amy Spangler, CNP, is a certified nurse practitioner at </em><a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/urgentcare4kids\"><em>ProMedica Urgent Care for Kids</em></a><em>, located in Perrysburg.</em>",

    "Title": "Talking With Teens About Safe Driving",
    "Content": "Getting a driver’s permit or license comes with a new amount of freedom for teens — but also a new amount of risk. In fact, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, inexperienced teen drivers are twice as likely as adult drivers to be in a fatal crash.\n\nThe Injury Prevention team at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-russell-j-ebeid-childrens-hospital\">ProMedica Russell J Ebeid Children’s Hospital</a> is tackling the topic of safe teen driving with a hands-on collaborative approach. Through efforts in local schools and other community organizations, injury prevention specialists Payton Bowyer, MPH, CPST, and Taylor Meehan, BSPH, CPST, help teens and parents recognize the risks of the road and make safe decisions before handing over the keys.\n<h2>Recognize Top Teen Driving Risks</h2>\nKnowing the leading causes of teen car accidents can help parents prepare young drivers to drive safely on the road. Bowyer and Meehan outline three risks that contribute to teen car crashes.\n<h3>1. Distracted Driving</h3>\nWhen the brain is distracted, it can make it challenging to react during a potential crash. “Cell phones, eating and drinking are common distractions for young drivers,” says Bowyer. Talking and texting take a driver’s hands and minds off the road. But apps like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram are also tempting teens to be on their phones while driving or in traffic. Encouraging teens to set their phones to a “do not disturb” setting or keeping their cell phone out of reach while behind the wheel can help them stay focused on the road.\n\nHands-free cell phone use is not only a danger to inexperienced drivers, but to all drivers in general. “We tell teens not to do hands-free talking or texting while driving either,” says Bowyer. “Because even if you aren’t pushing buttons, these activities still take your mind off the road.”\n<h3>2. Friends in the Car</h3>\nFriends and additional passengers in the car can be a major distraction to young drivers. Conversations, loud music and activity can affect a driver’s focus and increase the likelihood of a crash.\n\n“Every time you add a passenger to your car, your risk of being in a crash increases exponentially,” says Meehan. “That’s why almost every state has laws about limiting passengers in the car for drivers under 18.\n<h3>3. Speeding and Risky Driving</h3>\nSome of the common risks associated with risky driving include speeding, accelerating too quickly, swerving and slamming on the brakes. Each of these actions increases the likelihood of a crash occurring.\n\n“With fewer cars on the road during the pandemic, there’s more temptation and ability to speed,” says Bowyer.\n\nParents should have conversations with their teen drivers about speeding, how to manage speed for different road conditions, weather and traffic. They should also talk about other risky driving behaviors.\n<h2>Talk with Your Teen Early and Often</h2>\nBowyer and Meehan recommend having conversations with your kids about safe driving early and often. Teenagers are still developing emotional maturity, and they learn and absorb information differently than adults.\n\nThey also recommend steering clear of lectures and scare tactics, which are less likely to influence their behavior. Instead, parents should consider using real-life examples and providing short-term consequences.\n<h3>Discuss the Importance of Seatbelts</h3>\nTeens have a tendency not to buckle up (or require their passengers to), even though the <a href=\"ttps://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/seatbeltuse/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> says that wearing a seatbelt can reduce serious injuries and death in crashes by 50%.\n\n“We’re seeing a correlation between not wearing a seatbelt and more severe injuries — and even fatalities — in car accidents,” says Meehan. “Teens are taking the risk, expecting the airbags to protect them and relying on advanced safety features in the car. But airbags are meant to work with a seatbelt; they’re not meant to protect you on their own.”\n\nTalk with your teen about the benefits of buckling up and encourage seatbelt use for everyone in the car.\n<h3>Be Prepared As a Parent</h3>\nAdditionally, parents can prepare for conversations with teen drivers by:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Creating a safe driving contract.</strong> Have a conversation with your teen about ground rules for safe driving and agree on the consequences if they violate the rules. The CDC has a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/MotorVehicleSafety/pdf/Driving_Contract-a.pdf\">parent-teen driving contract</a> that parents can use to help their teens become responsible drivers.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Knowing your state laws.</strong> All 50 states have developed three-stage graduated driver licensing systems. These laws set restrictions for night driving, passengers and cell phone use while behind the wheel.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Setting a good example. </strong>Your teens have been watching you behind the wheel since they were in car seats. Set a good example by wearing a seatbelt for every trip, keeping your eyes and hands on the road, following speed limits, obeying laws and avoiding distractions.</li>\n</ul>\nAs a parent, you play a critical role in helping your teen balance the responsibilities and risks that come with driving. Supporting them and setting standards while gaining experience can help them become safe and confident behind the wheel.",

    "Title": "Preventing Fall-Related Injuries Among Older Adults",
    "Content": "According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/falls/adultfalls.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),</a> more than one out of every four older people experience a fall each year. Falls may lead to emergency care, serious injuries and even a fear of returning to everyday activities.\n\nFalls may be common, but they are also preventable. Identifying the risks for falls and making the right changes can help keep people safer and help prevent injuries.\n\n“There are many factors that can contribute to a person’s risk for falling, including their overall health and strength, medications, and fall hazards around them,” said Jake Collins, MPH, Injury Prevention Coordinator, ProMedica. “When we look at fall prevention, we have to consider all these different aspects. But we also know that most falls happen inside or around a person’s home, so making sure their home environment is safe is very important.”\n<h2>Take care of your overall health.</h2>\nRegular check-ups and eye exams can help identify conditions that cause dizziness or vision impairment. Make sure that your eyewear prescriptions are up to date, too. If you’re having issues with balance, dizziness or lightheadedness, be sure to bring it up to your healthcare provider. Developing an exercise program to improve balance, flexibility and strength is also beneficial.\n<h2>Understand your medications.</h2>\nCertain medications, such as antidepressants, may cause drowsiness or lightheadedness. Some may also affect your blood pressure, causing sudden dizziness or lightheadedness when you stand from a sitting or lying position. Be sure to ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist about any potential side effects of prescription and over-the-counter medications you are taking. Consuming alcohol may also increase the side effects of your medications.\n<h2>Use and wear the right gear.</h2>\nWearing slippers or socks without shoes can increase your risk for slips and falls. Wear low heeled, rubber-soled shoes with good support instead. And, if you feel unsteady, use a cane or walker for balance as needed. Be sure to have your feet assessed by your healthcare provider each year to monitor your foot health and address any symptoms you may be having, such as numbness or tingling.\n<h2>Keep your home environment safe.</h2>\nIt’s important to have good lighting throughout the house so that you can see where you’re going and any potential obstacles. This is especially important in stairways and halls. Keep walkways and floors clear of clutter and avoid floor coverings that aren’t attached to the floor. Throw rugs, for instance, can bunch up or slip and cause a fall. Install grab bars near the toilet and bathtub to help you move safely and put a non-skid carpet or rug beside the bathtub to keep the floor dry.\n<h2>Talk with your healthcare provider about any falls.</h2>\nIf you do fall, be sure to notify your healthcare provider, even if you don’t have any injuries. Those who experience a fall are also at a higher risk for future falls. It’s important to know that falling isn’t an inevitable part of getting older. Talk with your healthcare provider about steps you can take to stay safe.",

    "Title": "Women: Take Control of Your Heart Health",
    "Content": "As women, we know it’s important to get regular checkups to screen breast cancer, cervical cancer and other female-specific health concerns. What many of us don’t think about, however, is monitoring for signs of heart disease — even though it’s the leading cause of death for women in the United States.\n\nThe good news is there are steps you can take to protect your heart, starting with understanding why you may be at risk.\n<h2>Women Have a Unique Risk for Heart Disease</h2>\nMen and women share many of the same risk factors for heart disease, including smoking, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\n“But while heart disease can be preventable, women tend to prioritize care for others instead of themselves,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/laura-debenedetti-md-facc-cardiology\">Laura DeBenedetti, MD, FACC,</a> a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians. “You often have many people you’re caring for in addition to yourself. So, self-care — including maintaining a healthy diet, exercising and getting enough sleep — can be difficult as you’re working to care for so many others in your life,” she says.\n\nManaging busy home and work lives means women might also be likely to experience long-term stress, which increases the stress hormone cortisol in the body. Cortisol, in turn, affects the way the body controls blood pressure and blood sugar. And, over time, all of these factors can contribute to heart disease.\n<h2>How Heart Attacks Look Different for Women</h2>\nWhen it comes to heart attacks, the most common symptom for both men and women is chest pain or discomfort. However, women are more likely to experience lesser-known heart attack symptoms, such as:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Back or jaw pain.</li>\n \t<li>New or profound fatigue.</li>\n \t<li>New or profound indigestion.</li>\n \t<li>Shortness of breath.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you have concerns about your heart, it’s important to speak up. Physicians now have a greater understanding of how to help women who are experiencing signs and symptoms. If you think you may be having a heart attack, call 911.\n<h2>Starting with Slow, Positive Changes</h2>\nSome risk factors for heart disease, such as family history, are outside of your control. But there’s still a lot you can do to keep your heart healthy. Dr. DeBenedetti recommends:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Establishing a relationship with a physician.</strong> Talking about and monitoring things like your blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol will go a long way in catching any potential signals of heart disease before any damage is done to your heart.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Finding a physical activity or exercise regimen you enjoy.</strong> You’re more likely to keep up with exercise when it’s something you like — and even look forward to — doing. Aim to exercise for at least 30 minutes, three times a week, unless otherwise directed by your doctor.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Quitting smoking.</strong> Even if you’ve been a long-term smoker, quitting now will lower your risk of heart attack. When you’re ready, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation\">ProMedica’s Tobacco Cessation Program</a> offers support for every step of your journey.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Making changes to your diet.</strong> A diet that includes plenty of lean proteins, fresh fruits and vegetables will go a long way in safeguarding your heart. We know change can be hard, so it’s okay to start slow. Even just having healthier snacks within reach is progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Know Your Heart Is Worth It</h2>\nRemember this is a marathon, not a sprint. It can be hard to make lifestyle changes overnight. Take it one day at a time. And if you veer off track, don’t beat yourself up. Just stay focused on how you can get back to making healthier choices — and remind yourself why you’re doing it.\n\nKeeping your heart healthy will improve your quality of life, help you stay active as you get older and can potentially even prolong your life. “Do what you can that’s in your control,” Dr. DeBenedetti says. “None of this is easy. I work on it myself, every day. But these changes can add years to your life and literal life to your years.”",

    "Title": "Kids and Sleep: Ensuring a Good Night's Rest",
    "Content": "When you first brought your child home from the hospital, sleep was likely a big topic of conversation in your family. How your baby slept — or didn’t — at night could have a big impact on your days. As your child grows, sleep continues to play an important role in their development and can affect your whole family’s health.\n\nSleep medicine specialists at ProMedica say while sleep problems in children and teens are common, they’re underdiagnosed and shouldn’t be overlooked.\n<h2>Why is sleep so important?</h2>\nSleep is our body’s natural reset button and is an essential building block to both our physical and mental health. “If your child is having trouble getting enough sleep or is getting poor quality sleep, it’s important to help them fix those problems,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/hassan-dbouk-md-faap-pediatric-pulmonary-and-sleep-medicine\">Hassan Dbouk, MD,</a> a children’s sleep specialist with ProMedica Physicians.\n\nBetter sleep quality can affect your child in positive ways during the day. It can significantly improve behavioral problems, such as hyperactivity, and school performance.\n\nWhen thinking about your child’s sleep, consider the following factors. Does your child:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Get enough sleep? (The minimum number of hours recommended by the <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/news/Pages/AAP-Supports-Childhood-Sleep-Guidelines.aspx\">American Academy of Pediatrics</a> ranges from 8 to 12, depending on age.)</li>\n \t<li>Have a regular bedtime schedule and routine?</li>\n \t<li>Sleep free from interruptions, such as loud snoring, pauses in breathing or restless movement?</li>\n \t<li>Sleep without distractions, such as electronics or distracting noises?</li>\n</ul>\nIf you answered “no” to any of the above, it’s worth thinking about how to help your child get an easier night’s rest.\n<h2>Common Sleep Conditions in Children</h2>\nSleep can be affected by a wide spectrum of issues, including mental health conditions. If your child is having trouble sleeping, talking to your child’s pediatrician may help you get to the bottom of what’s causing the problem. In some cases, you may be referred to a sleep specialist.\n\nAccording to Dr. Dbouk, some common sleep conditions include:\n\n<strong>Sleep apnea.</strong> Children with sleep apnea may snore loudly, appear to stop breathing for a moment while sleeping or move restlessly during the night, interfering with their ability to get true rest.\n\n<strong>Restless leg syndrome</strong>. Kids with restless leg syndrome may have an uncomfortable feeling in their legs when they’re trying to lay down at night, which prevents them from falling asleep.\n\n<strong>Increased daytime sleepiness.</strong> Also called hypersomnia, this condition is usually caused when a child doesn’t get enough sleep or has a poor quality of sleep. Children may feel sleepy during the day even after a “full night” of sleep.\n\n<strong>Insomnia.</strong> Children with insomnia might have trouble falling — or staying — asleep. There are many potential causes, including lifestyle or behavioral factors, or other medical issues.\n\n<strong>Sleep disturbances</strong>. Children may experience interruptions to their sleep, such as sleep walking or talking, teeth grinding, nightmares or night terrors. In many cases, these issues resolve on their own, but doctors will check to make sure they’re not caused by an underlying medical condition.\n\nDuring your visit with a sleep specialist, you’ll be asked questions about your child’s medical history. The specialist will listen to your concerns and conduct a thorough physical exam. After this consultation, it’s common to recommend an overnight sleep study.\n<h3>What is a sleep study?</h3>\nA sleep study helps doctors see the full picture of what a night’s sleep looks like for your child. Your child will sleep in a private room in a sleep lab for the night, while their breathing, sleep stages, heart rate and movement are monitored.\n\nAs a parent, you’re welcome to sleep in the room with your child in a nearby bed. You can also arrange to visit the sleep lab prior to spending the night to help your child feel more comfortable if needed.\n<h2>What does treatment look like?</h2>\nTreatment depends on your child’s age and medical needs, and may include lifestyle changes, medication, surgery or other recommendations.\n\nAt ProMedica, pediatric sleep doctors have close relationships with other pediatric medical experts including ear, nose and throat specialists, heart and lung specialists, behavior specialists, and weight and wellness specialists. Since sleep issues can have a wide number of causes and treatments, this kind of team helps ensure the right course of action is taken for your child.\n\nFinding the right care and reassurance often helps parents sleep easier as well.\n\n“We’re lucky at ProMedica to have a comprehensive team for these issues,” says Dr. Dbouk. “Our aim is to deliver state-of-the-art evaluation and treatment.”\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/hassan-dbouk-md-faap-pediatric-pulmonary-and-sleep-medicine\">Dr. Dbouk</a> is a sleep specialist with ProMedica Physicians. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-pediatric-pulmonary-and-sleep-medicine-and-cystic-fibrosis-toledo\">Learn more</a> about pediatric sleep care.</em>",

    "Title": "6 Tips for Managing Menstrual Issues",
    "Content": "Does your cycle have you feeling up and down? Menstrual cycle- and menopause-related health concerns are common, and often uncomfortable. If you experience symptoms of pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS), such as bloating, cramping, fatigue or mood swings or irregular bleeding or hot flashes due to perimenopause or menopause, you know how easily they can ruin your day. But the good news is, most of these symptoms are manageable with lifestyle changes or over-the-counter remedies.\n<h2>1. Get regular exercise.</h2>\nRegular exercise can be helpful in easing menstrual cramping and fatigue. Low-intensity physical activities such as walking, hiking and bike riding can keep your heart healthy and soothe these symptoms.\n\nIf you’re just starting out, try walking for 30 minutes a day. You can even take three 10-minute walks throughout the day if that works better for you. Do your best to keep your exercise regime consistent and then, as you get stronger, work up to even more activity. Make it a goal to be active for 45 minutes or more at a time, three to five days a week, to reap optimal benefits.\n<h2>2. Manage your stress.</h2>\nAny kind of stress (even when it’s caused by happy events) can take a toll on your body — and many women find that being stressed makes their menopause symptoms worse, especially if stress levels keep them from getting quality sleep.\n\nFind a few minutes each day to practice a relaxation technique, like deep breathing exercises that can calm your body and mind. Engaging in hobbies you enjoy, spending time with people you love, and practicing self-care are also effective techniques for relieving stress.\n<h2>3. Stay hydrated.</h2>\nYou already know how important it is to drink water regularly throughout the day to keep your body hydrated. But did you know there are lots of ways to prevent dehydration? And some that don’t have anything to do with drinking water?\n\nVarious foods from nature — nuts, oils, seeds, avocados and sweet potatoes, for example — are highly effective at nourishing and cooling the body. These whole foods are filled with vitamins and minerals that can build the body’s reserves and provide healthy fats and natural oils to help your body work better.\n\nEvery time you eat, make sure you’re choosing foods that nourish your body and satisfy your hunger and thirst.\n<h2>4. Use an ice pack.</h2>\nBy simply applying a cold towel or an icepack to the back of your neck, you can help cool your body while you’re experiencing a hot flash. You can even use a bag of frozen vegetables or a cold bottle of water — whatever you have available and works for you.\n\nHold the cold surface against your skin at the base of your neck. Since this is the point where cold and hot temperatures most easily enter your body, it’s the best spot for helping you to regulate your body temperature. If night sweats are an issue keep a gel pack that stays cold for long on your night stand and use as needed.\n<h2>5. Try acupuncture.</h2>\nAcupuncture can be helpful for managing symptoms of menopause, as well as for general hormonal health. If you think acupuncture treatments may be a good fit for you, we offer services at <a href=\"https://promedicanaturalwellnessshop.com/\">ProMedica Natural Wellness Shop</a>.\n<h2>6. Use natural medicines.</h2>\nHerbs and natural medicines have helped many women reduce or relieve symptoms of cycle-related issues or discomfort:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Black cohosh</strong> is a medicinal herb that women find particularly helpful for treating hot flashes. However, since black cohosh can increase your body’s estrogen production, check with your doctor before trying it (especially if you or a family member has a history of breast cancer).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Cramp bark</strong>, which comes from a flowering shrub grown in many parts of the world, has historically been used to treat menstrual cramping and inflammation of the uterus.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Vitex</strong> is an herb that may lessen symptoms of PMS and Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), such as swelling, cramping, mood swings and headaches. Research studies suggest that taking Vitex may also help alleviate breast tenderness.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Always consult a physician before starting any supplement or diet changes.</em>\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "Helping Kids with Behavioral Health Needs",
    "Content": "As a parent, you want the best for your children. But when your child is struggling with emotions or behavior, it can be difficult to talk about and even harder to know when it’s time to get medical care.\n\nYou’re not alone: One in six U.S. children between the ages of 2 to 8 has a diagnosed mental, behavioral or developmental disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) — and that means there are a great many parents, just like you, in need of resources. That’s why the experts at ProMedica’s Cullen Center are weighing in to answer a few frequently asked questions.\n<h2>How do I know if my child needs help?</h2>\nIt’s important to remember that some degree of struggle (even acting out) is expected, and developmentally appropriate. So really, it’s more about how often it happens, how long it’s been happening and whether or not the behaviors are age-appropriate.\n\n“Changes in behavior or routine — especially if they last for weeks or months and interfere with your child’s ability to engage in the activities of daily living — can be a sign that your child is struggling,” explains <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/adrienne-fricker-elhai-phd-child-psychology\">Adrienne Fricker-Elhai, PhD,</a> director of The Cullen Center at ProMedica, an outpatient pediatric therapy center.\n\nMany of those signs depend on your child’s age:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>For younger children: </strong>Signs often appear as regression on their milestones. For instance, they were potty-trained but are wetting themselves again.</li>\n \t<li><strong>For school-aged children: </strong>Signs may appear as a lack of interest in activities they used to love, such as playing with friends.</li>\n \t<li><strong>For teenagers:</strong> Signs usually appear as heightened moodiness and irritability.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you’re concerned your child’s behavior is more than a phase, it can be helpful to take notes about changes or patterns in behavior. When it comes time to talk with a physician or counselor, your notes will help you provide good examples and information.\n<h3>A Word About COVID-19</h3>\nThis past year has been especially trying. Many children and teens felt increased anxiety and fear as they struggled to understand the changing world around them. And that means their parents have seen a natural increase in behavior problems that come with anxiety, such as temper tantrums or defiance. As we return to more normal daily activities, take note if your child’s behaviors don’t also return to what’s more typical for them.\n<h2>What if my child has experienced trauma?</h2>\n“We need to take away the stigma around asking for help in dealing with mental health, and also de-stigmatize the fact that people experience trauma and abuse,” says Dr. Fricker-Elhai. “It happens, and we need to let children and families know it’s OK to talk about it. The more you bury things, the more likely they are to come back to you in different and harmful ways.”\n\nAt the Cullen Center, therapists help children who have gone through trauma, abuse or loss by working together with families to create goals and provide evidence-informed treatment that leads to healing. Treatment plans will look different for each child. Therapists might help a young child through play, for example, while they can speak more directly to a teenager about what’s going on in their life.\n<h2>Helping Every Child Thrive</h2>\nEvery child’s needs are unique. If you’ve noticed a change in your child’s behavior or mood lately and it doesn’t seem to be passing, consider talking with your child’s pediatrician to connect you to the right resources.\n\nIf your child has experienced a traumatic event, abuse or loss, you can call the Cullen Center directly and speak to a social worker to find out if their services are the right fit. No matter what your family has experienced, finding help can go a long way, both now and as your child grows up.\n\n“I believe in hope always,” says Dr. Fricker-Elhai. “With help, your child will be able to heal and thrive.”\n\n<em>To learn more about The Cullen Center, visit </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/the-cullen-center\"><em>ProMedica.org</em></a><em>.</em>",

    "Title": "The Truth Behind Breastfeeding Trends on Social Media",
    "Content": "If you’re a future parent searching for advice on breastfeeding or a new mom scrolling through social media during feeding sessions, chances are you’ve come across a multitude of information. While social media can empower you, provide education and connect you with others who are going through a similar situation, it can also set unrealistic expectations — simultaneously creating both a platform for great content and misinformation.\n\nSo how can you know which trends are based on clinical best practices and which you should ignore? Since lactation consultants hear all the latest social media trends for breastfeeding, we asked two of ProMedica’s own to help you cut through the noise.\n<h2>1. “Breast is Best” or “Fed is Best” Mantras</h2>\nYou may have seen “breast is best” to promote breastfeeding or “fed is best” to take the pressure off. But those ideas may be too limiting for breastfeeding parents and their babies.\n\n“We think educated is best,” says Megan Schlachter, MSN, RN-IBCLC and Megan Whitacre, MSN, RN-IBCLC, lactation consultants and parent instructors. “Every family and baby are different.”\n\nBreastfeeding has amazing benefits, including boosting your baby’s immune system. But it’s not all-or-nothing. In reality, there’s no perfect breastfeeding experience. Any breast milk is beneficial to your baby. At ProMedica, we consider it our job is to make sure your baby is getting fed, and it’s working for both Mom and baby.\n<h2>2. “The Freezer Stash of Breast Milk\"</h2>\nIf you’ve searched the internet for information on breastfeeding, you’ve likely seen pictures of giant freezer stashes of breast milk. But according to our consultants, parents shouldn’t feel the pressure to save this much milk.\n\nBreastfeeding parents often work, so it’s important to have some milk available. But people often panic and want a big stash before they go back to work. Keep in mind you’ll also be pumping while you’re away from your baby. So as long as you’ve saved up a little, you’ll have enough.\n\nTrying to drastically increase your milk supply to create a stash can be both mentally and physically stressful. And sometimes, oversupply of breast milk can cause medical issues for parent and baby.\n<h2>3. The “Experts”</h2>\nFor the qualified experts, social media is a great tool that helps them share their professional knowledge. But not everyone is an expert.\n\nWhitacre recommends going the old-fashioned route and getting books by qualified experts or taking breastfeeding classes at your local hospital. She also notes that it’s always appropriate bring questions to your physician or lactation consultant.\n\n“There’s a lot of information on the internet to navigate. Instead, talk to an International Board-Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). We’re here to help with the pros, the cons, and how to make it possible.”\n<h2>4. Breastfeeding Selfies that Make It Look Effortless</h2>\nYou already know that social media is often filled with carefully curated images. People often choose to present only their best sides online. This is true for breastfeeding too.\n\n“I hear all the time, ‘I thought this was supposed to be natural,’” says Schlachter. “And by natural, they mean effortless and easy. I try to remind new moms that childbirth is also natural. But that doesn’t mean it comes without challenges.”\n\nIt’s OK if your breastfeeding journey doesn’t go as expected. It’s actually a learned skill for both you and your baby. Allow yourself time and grace as you work through the learning curve.\n<h2>We’re Here When You Need Help</h2>\nWhitacre sums it up well: “Breastfeeding. Motherhood. It’s all a journey.”\n\nIt’s our goal at ProMedica to be by your side for every twist and turn. If you have questions or would like to schedule a lactation appointment, call ProMedica’s breastfeeding WARMLINE at <a href=\"tel:419-291-4577\">419-291-4577</a>.",

    "Title": "Back to School: Developing a Great Sleep Schedule",
    "Content": "As summer break comes to a close and back-to-school preparation begins, it is vitally important to help your children get back on a good sleep schedule. Often, children go to bed later and sleep in during the summer months, and adjusting to a school schedule can be a shock to the system. Sleep is clearly linked with better outcomes such as improved attention, memory and mental and physical health.\n\nHere are some actions to take to ease the back-to-school sleep transition:\n<h2>Determine Hours of Sleep Needed</h2>\nThe American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that kindergarten through twelfth-grade students get between nine and 11 hours of sleep. You can use the academy’s online <a href=\"https://sleepeducation.org/healthy-sleep/bedtime-calculator/\">sleep calculator</a> to calculate the hours of sleep needed for your child based on age and wake time.\n<h2>Limit Caffeine and Sugar</h2>\nAvoiding any caffeine or sugar after 2 p.m. is best for sleep patterns. Studies have shown that caffeine intake can make it hard to fall asleep, and consuming sugar can affect your ability to stay asleep.\n<h2>Set a Consistent Schedule</h2>\nIt’s really important to have a set time to fall asleep as well as a set time to wake up, based on the amount of sleep needed. Younger children still may need a nap, but it should be no later than 2 p.m. Middle and high school students should avoid naps as it will disrupt the natural sleep drive.\n<h2>Turn Screens Off</h2>\nBlue light from television screens, phones and computer monitors can interfere with the production of the hormone melatonin, which is an important factor in the sleep-wake cycle. If your child is playing video games or watching TV before bed, it is likely to keep your child up an extra 30 to 60 minutes. So, be sure to turn off the screens at least two hours before bedtime.\n<h2>Use the 15-minute Method</h2>\nIt’s best to gradually adjust to a new sleep cycle over a series of days or weeks. Slowly move bedtime earlier by 15 minutes every few days until the ideal number of hours is achieved.\n\nSleep should not be underestimated as an integral part of overall health. Start the school year off right with a great routine!\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jenna-kado-md-sleep-medicine\">Jenna Kado, MD,</a> is an internist and sleep doctor with ProMedica Physicians Pulmonary/Sleep Medicine.</em>",

    "Title": "Get to the Root of the Problem: 4 Tips for Healthier Hair",
    "Content": "Everybody has a bad hair day now and then, and it’s usually nothing to worry about. But if you’ve noticed lately that your hair doesn’t seem as healthy as usual, it might be a good idea to look at the reasons why.\n\nChanges to your hair — particularly hair loss — can have many causes, including age, genetics hormonal changes, illness and injury. Even day-to-day stress caused by work or traffic, for example, can take a toll on your body’s resources and impact hair quality.\n<h2>1. Manage stress.</h2>\nStress can cause chemical changes that affect the hair follicles If stress is contributing to your hair loss, there are a few remedies you can try.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Acupuncture</strong> is a reliable form of stress relief and may help by decreasing cortisol levels (your body’s primary stress hormone).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Regular exercise and meditation</strong> are great strategies for managing stress. A few deep-breathing exercises a few times a day can help you relax and feel more in control.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Scalp massage</strong> can be both relaxing and effective at stimulating skin and hair follicles. Once a day, gently rub the top of your head with your fingertips or work it into your regular hair washings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. See a physician.</h2>\nMany kinds of hormonal changes and issues can lead to hair thinning. Pregnancy, childbirth, breastfeeding, menopause and testosterone fluctuations are all perfectly normal and healthy events, but they can cause changes to your hair. Some medications may also may affect the levels of hormones in your body or contribute to hair loss.\n\nIf you’re concerned about any of these causes, see a doctor. Your primary care provider or specialist may be able to help you identify ways to improve the appearance and health of your hair.\n<h2>3. Balance your gut health.</h2>\nHave you ever heard the phrase: <em>An apple a day keeps the doctor away</em>? It’s no secret that good nutrition can help prevent, manage, and possibly even overcome, conditions that affect your health — including your hair health. In fact, digestive imbalances can indirectly affect hair.\n\nRegular water intake and a diet rich in healthy, whole foods like fruits, vegetables, lean protein, whole grains and healthy fats are important for your overall — and hair — health.\n<h2>4. Try an over-the-counter supplement.</h2>\nNatural supplements and over-the-counter dietary aids may help improve hair health and contribute directly to hair regrowth by helping you manage stress and balance your digestive system.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nThe <a href=\"https://nutrafol.com/\">Nutrafol</a> supplement line has formulas designed to help promote hair wellness and address the main concerns leading to hair loss.

    "Title": "Discover How Breastfeeding Builds Your Baby’s Immunity",
    "Content": "As a new parent, it’s normal for your every instinct to be centered around how to protect your tiny newborn. We test car seats, keep their little bodies covered, slather them with sunscreen, limit their exposure to others, make sure they go to sleep on their backs and vaccinate them. But what we often don’t consider is how we can protect them in terms of proactively boosting their immune systems.\n\nProMedica lactation consultants and parent instructors Megan Whitacre, MSN, RN-IBCLC, and Megan Schlachter, MSN, RN-IBCLC, department manager, weigh in on how.\n<h2>Your baby gets a natural boost at birth.<strong>\n</strong></h2>\nWhile adults make many antibodies that safeguard us from getting sick, babies are born with immature immune systems. But Whitacre shares the good news that babies get a boost of IgG antibodies from their moms at the end of pregnancy that helps protect infants during their first 6 months of life.\n<h2>Breastfeeding shares antibodies with your baby.</h2>\nBreastfeeding provides even more protection for your baby. That’s one of the reasons the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization recommend it exclusively, whenever possible, for at least the first six months. But regardless of how long or how often you breastfeed, remember that any breast milk is a gift for your baby.\n\nBreastmilk contains antibodies called immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG and IgM) that pass along some of your immunity to your child, including coating and protecting your baby’s mucous membranes to keep out bacteria and viruses when they make contact. This is especially helpful considering babies are prone to respiratory infections.\n\nBreastfeeding parents also make specific antibodies for the germs in their environment. While breastfeeding, your baby can better tackle the germs you encounter daily through the immunoglobins you pass on in your breastmilk.\n<h2>Breastfeeding helps your baby’s gut health.</h2>\nAccording to Schlachter, breastmilk contains human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which are sugars your baby can’t digest. These sugars play an important role in setting up your baby’s immune system since they prevent bacteria and viruses from sticking to your baby’s cells. And when germs don’t stick, they often die and can’t make your baby sick.\n\nThe HMOs in breastmilk also help your baby’s gut health by feeding the good bacteria while stopping the growth of bad bacteria. And a healthy gut is a foundation for a healthy immune system.\n<h2>Breastfeeding has benefits now and later.</h2>\nBreastfeeding offers short- and long-term benefits for your baby’s immunity.\n<h3>In the First Few Days</h3>\nSometimes referred to as “liquid gold,” the milk you produce for the first few days (colostrum) has the highest amounts of antibodies and HMOs. Colostrum also helps babies make white blood cells, which are a crucial part of their immune systems. In fact, Whitacre says, “You can see on X-rays that babies who breastfeed have a larger, more developed thymus gland, which is an immune organ that helps mature the white blood cells.”\n<h3>While Breastfeeding<strong>\n</strong></h3>\nWhile breastfeeding, babies are getting power-packed nutrition that keeps them from getting sick. Breastfeeding children have a decreased risk of:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cold and flu.</li>\n \t<li>Diarrhea and vomiting.</li>\n \t<li>Ear infections.</li>\n \t<li>Gut infections.</li>\n \t<li>Respiratory infections.</li>\n</ul>\nEven if your baby gets sick, breastmilk can help them get better. When a breastfeeding parent and baby are exposed to an illness, a mother’s breastmilk adapts, giving your baby new antibodies to fight off the infection.\n<h3>Beyond Breastfeeding</h3>\nWhen young children get an illness often, they have a higher chance of struggling with it when they’re older too. By breastfeeding, you can prevent your child coming down with something repeatedly. People who breastfed as children also have a lower risk for diseases like asthma, obesity, and diabetes.\n<h2>Educated is best.</h2>\nThe topic of breastfeeding is complex, and there is no single “right way” to feed your baby. Each parent-child relationship is unique.\n\n“But the more you educate yourself, the more confident you’ll be in your body’s ability to do what it’s made to do,” says Whitacre. “It’s also important to remember that you can have all the education out there and still have breastfeeding problems. So, write down your questions and talk to your doctor or lactation consultant.”\n\n“Our job is not to make these decisions for you. It’s to provide education to help you make an informed decision for your family,” says Schlachter. “We’re here to help families reach their breastfeeding goals, whatever they are.”\n\n<em>ProMedica’s lactation consultants are ready to help by phone or by appointment.

    "Title": "Keeping Unvaccinated Kids Safe from COVID-19",
    "Content": "Millions of vaccinated Americans are breathing a sigh of relief this summer as they return to favorite family pastimes. But for families with children too young to be vaccinated, some summer activities still require a level of caution.\n\nSo what events are safe, and what tips should families follow to stay healthy? Brian Kaminski, DO, CPPS, a board-certified emergency medicine physician and vice president of quality and patient safety at ProMedica, weighed in on the risks and benefits of socializing and what precautions are still needed for unvaccinated kids.\n<h2>Consider the Safety of the Scenario</h2>\nThe availability of vaccines for adults and older kids has made it safer to be out in the community. Still, families will have to consider the risks and benefits for each scenario before making plans and when considering what precautions to take.\n\n“I encourage parents, as they feel comfortable, to get back into social settings,” said Dr. Kaminski. “The pandemic has taken a toll on mental health and increased feelings of isolation across all ages. As we move out of the pandemic restrictions, most people, including children, can participate in more activities. But parents will have to exercise some judgment depending on the level of risk.”\n<h3>Public Events</h3>\nWhen it comes to large, crowded events, keeping kids outdoors reduces their risk of infection and the possibility of spreading the virus to others. “We definitely know that outdoor activity is much safer than indoor activity,” said Dr. Kaminski. “If a child is in contact with another person with COVID-19, there’s still a risk of transmission when they’re spending a lot of time together outdoors. But it’s far less of a risk than spending time in close contact indoors with minimal air circulation.”\n\nStill, if an unvaccinated child will be visiting locales like theme parks, parades or sports events, they’ll be best protected by wearing a mask. Indoor events like movie theaters, museums or restaurants and the like also pose a greater risk for kids, so it’s a good idea to keep them masked.\n<h3>Gatherings with Friends and Family</h3>\nPlaydates and social events depend on your immediate family’s situation.\n\n“If everyone in your household is vaccinated and low-risk — and those in the other family are vaccinated — then it’s safer to get together,” said Dr. Kaminksi. “On the other hand, if you have unvaccinated high-risk people in your household, you should strongly consider the possibility your child may expose those individuals to the virus.”\n\nWhen mingling with other friends or family, staying outdoors is your best bet if you have unvaccinated kids or other high-risk people in your household.\n\nWhat about visits from grandma and grandpa? Dr. Kaminski agreed with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendation that kids can safely have close contact with vaccinated grandparents. If a grandparent hasn’t been vaccinated, it’s best to refrain from visiting just yet.\n<h2>Prevent COVID-19 in Kids</h2>\nWhile children tend to have more mild cases of COVID-19, it can still lead to serious illness in some kids. And children of all ages can play a role in the spread of COVID-19. According to Dr. Kaminski, the following tips can help keep your kids safe:\n<h3>Vaccinations</h3>\nThe best way parents can protect their children under 12 is by getting vaccinated and vaccinating siblings over 12. “Without a doubt, the top priority is to get vaccinated yourself. If you have younger unvaccinated children, you provide additional protection to your family by getting your shot,” said Dr. Kaminski.\n<h3>Preventive Measures</h3>\nBecause scientists are still learning about reinfection, it’s best to take the same precautions, even if your child has already had COVID-19. “When in public or large settings where you don’t know the vaccination status of others, continue using methods known to prevent COVID-19, including having children above the age of 2 wear a mask, practice social distancing and perform thorough handwashing,” said Dr. Kaminski.\n<h2>Vaccine Availability for Kids</h2>\nVaccine clinical trials are underway for children under 12. Once a vaccine is approved for kids, parents should feel confident that it has been thoroughly tested and proven safe. Dr. Kaminski explained, “While it’s understandable that people might be concerned about something so new, the data we have for adults and teens shows the vaccine is safe and highly effective. So, if we see the same data in younger kids, I encourage parents to get their children vaccinated.”\n\nDr. Kaminski added, “There is reason to be hopeful that we will see Emergency Use Authorization granted for the 5-12 age group in the coming months, so parents should begin considering the vaccination for children in this age group.”\n\nYour ProMedica family practitioner is here to help with any questions about the vaccine, the availability of the vaccine and its effectiveness.\n\n<em>Learn more about COVID-19 on <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/covid/\">ProMedica’s website</a>. </em>",

    "Title": "Raising Awareness of Prostate Cancer",
    "Content": "Prostate cancer, second only to skin cancer, is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 174,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed yearly.\n\nProstate cancer usually grows slowly. If confined to the prostate, it may not cause any serious damage. Prostate cancer is less likely than other cancers to spread to other parts of the body. However, in some cases, it can be more aggressive, making it one of the leading causes of cancer death among men of all races.\n<h2>Diagnosis</h2>\nOne in six men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during his lifetime. Men may have a higher risk for prostate cancer if they are African American, over the age of 65, have a family history of prostate cancer and/or live in North America, northwest Europe, Australia or Caribbean Islands.\n\nThe good news is, as with most cancers, the earlier you catch it, the easier it is to treat. Men, age 40 and older, should talk with their doctor to make an informed decision on prostate cancer testing based on personal risk factors.\n\nMany men with prostate cancer never experience symptoms and without screening, would never know they had the disease. There are some warning signs, and men should see a primary care provider if they experience bone pain, compression of the spine, painful urination, erectile dysfunction and/or blood in the urine.\n\nMany times, a simple blood test, called a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, can be a marker for prostate cancer and is generally recommended for men age 50-69.  The test measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate. The levels of PSA in the blood can be higher in men who have prostate cancer. The PSA level may also be elevated in other conditions that affect the prostate, so it is important for your primary care physician to interpret your PSA test results and make additional recommendations.\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\nDifferent types of treatment are available for prostate cancer. You and your doctor will decide which treatment is right for you. Some common treatments are surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and active surveillance.\n\nActive surveillance is careful observation of PSA test results and warning signs with the intention of providing treatment should the cancer show signs of progression. Since prostate cancer often grows very slowly, some men who have prostate cancer might never need treatment.\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\nA typical western diet, most prevalent to Americans, consists of high levels of meat consumption and highly processed foods, which are risk factors for many chronic illnesses, including prostate cancer.  A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and lean proteins can make a big difference in overall health. Specifically, lycopene, a carotenoid and antioxidant found in red-colored fruits and vegetables, such as tomatoes, has been investigated in many studies for its potential ability to prevent the development of prostate cancer.\n\n<em>Learn more about prostate cancer on <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/prostate-cancer\">ProMedica's website.</a></em>",

    "Title": "Ways to Keep Your Immune System Healthy",
    "Content": "I think we can all agree that 2020 was quite a unique year. It brought about many changes to all of us individually, professionally and certainly with regard to our health. For some people it allowed us to focus on our health more, since we found ourselves with “nothing to do” quite literally for a while. For others it turned into “too much alone time and too much down time.” Food became more about comfort and Netflix became our entertainment of choice.\n\nFast forward to 2021 and we are opening up the doors and cautiously easing back into some semblance of a routine. Now is a great time to decide what we will keep about our habits and what we “spring clean” and move away from. COVID-19 has also brought about a lot of discussion about how balanced our immune system is and how we can improve it. There are several things to consider and with summer coming, now is a good time to incorporate some of them.\n<h2>1. Eat more fruits and vegetables.</h2>\nThis is an excellent time of the year to be including more fresh produce. As my son says, “It’s FINALLY time to eat more than apples and oranges!” There is a wide variety of fruits and vegetables that will be available over the next few months and each one of them offers a myriad of vitamins, minerals and fiber -- all of which can help boost your immunity.\n<h2>2. Exercise.</h2>\nImmunity is built by improving your overall health, and exercise is certainly one of the ways we do that. Exercise is very beneficial for improving blood flow (circulation), reducing stress and reducing inflammation. All of which leads to improved immunity.\n<h2>3. Get adequate sleep.</h2>\nThere is a lot more research discussing the importance of quality sleep to keep us as healthy as possible. Sleep allows for us to rest, repair and rejuvenate. “Pushing through” just because we can, does not mean we are achieving our highest level of health. Our bodies need “down time” to be able to fight off infection and reduce inflammation.\n\nWhile you sleep, your immune system releases cytokines, a protein that helps promote sleep. A lack of sleep may decrease the production of cytokines. Cytokines need to increase when you have an infection or inflammation to tell the immune system what to do to fight off the infection.\n<h2>4. Manage stress.</h2>\nWhen stress is high we are more susceptible to infection. Increased stress leads to increased inflammation which can negatively affect our immunity.\n\nIncreased stress also has a secondary effect on immunity by encouraging us to eat more “sometimes” foods such as chips, sweets and high fat snacks. These are the opposite of well balanced, healthier options such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins.\n<h2>5. Consider herbal supplements.</h2>\nThere are many herbal supplements available on the market and many of them may be helpful for building immunity. It is always recommended to tell your doctor what types of herbal supplements you are taking, so they can let you know if there are any concerns about an interaction with prescription medications you are taking. It is also important to note that without paying close attention to the other points in this list, the herbal supplements won’t be as effective.\n\nImproving your immunity involves many steps including cleaning up eating habits, increasing physical activity, improving sleep habits and decreasing stress. The great news is that while improving your immune system you will also be improving your overall health!  It’s a win-win, even in the midst of a pandemic!\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

Regularly clean and disinfect commonly used surfaces and equipment and reduce shared equipment if possible. Practice good hand hygiene.\n<h2>Monitor Your Child’s Health</h2>\nWhile we continue to learn more about the COVID-19 virus, we know that children have a lower risk of getting infected, but are NOT risk free. Children can still become infected with COVID, some showing changes that can affect their ability to participate.\n\nIt is important to monitor your child's health regularly. Do NOT let your child participate if:\n\n<strong>Your child is feeling ill or showing symptoms of COVID-19. </strong>This includes fever, cough, difficulty breathing, nasal congestion, fatigue, sore throat, headache, vomiting, and diarrhea.\n\n<strong>If your child has been exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. </strong>Parents should promptly report the exposure to the school or league administrator, even if your child has no symptoms.\n<h2>If Your Child Tests Positive for COVID-19</h2>\nIf your child has had a positive COVID test, you should also report this to your child's school or sports league. You should review with your child's healthcare provider and school/league when it is safe to return as well as things you can do to make them more comfortable.\n\nThere have been cases of subtle heart changes and physical changes that can pose life-threatening complications with sports activity after COVID infection. <u>Any student with a positive test should seek evaluation by a medical professional prior to returning to physical activity. </u>It is recommended that those who are infected or those with exposure, regardless of symptoms, complete a minimum 14-day resting period and must have no symptoms for greater than 14 days before returning to sports.\n\nYour child's healthcare provider will complete an exam similar to their initial sports physical, but this time with special emphasis on heart-related questions, history and examination methods. They will also focus on the symptoms your child may have had while they were sick. Concerning symptoms or history may mean your child should be evaluated by a specialist, such as a cardiologist, to ensure their heart and body are in a healthy place to return.\n\nOnce your child is cleared by a healthcare provider and/or specialist and it is safe to return, it is recommended for a phased and slow approach to return to activity over a week or more. More specifics can be given by your child's doctor or sports league. Continue to monitor for symptoms such as dizziness, difficulty breathing, chest pain/pressure, decreased exercise tolerance or fainting.\n<h2>Don’t Forget a Sports Physical</h2>\nPandemic or not, it's a good idea and often required to have yearly sports participation exams. We want to help your child participate at their highest level in their chosen sport. Follow up with your child's doctor to make sure your child is ready for their next season; and ready to keep moving in the event of illness.\n\nSports physicals help to identify medical problems that could have risk of life-threatening complications. They also allow us to identify conditions that may need treatment or rehabilitation like a muscle strain or sprain or broken bone before your child participates. That is why we ask that you have these physicals done 4-6 weeks prior to the start of their season. We also want to make sure that your child does not have any unnecessary restrictions so that they can perform their best.\n\nA sports physical often includes:\n<h3>Evaluation Forms</h3>\nYou will be asked to answer many questions about current and past medical history, family history, medications, and any health concerns. Forms are usually provided by your school’s athletic department or sports organization.\n<h3>Review</h3>\nThe provider working with you and your child will have an in-depth review regarding your child's medical history, past family history, injuries, current medications, current treatments, and specialists your child may see. We need a well-rounded picture to make sure we can help your child compete at their best level.\n<h3>Physical Exam</h3>\nWe will complete a full physical exam, looking at and examining all body systems to make sure your child is physically well before they participate.\n<h3>Forms</h3>\nWe will discuss all questions and concerns with you and your child before you leave the office. Depending on your visit, we may recommend follow with your child's family doctor or specialists before participation.\n\nEven if your child has not been out due to illness or exposure, many children have been off for several months or longer with limited times of practice. After being away from sports for an extended time, a slow increase of activity can help prevent and decrease risk of injury. Remember to have fun and be safe!\n\n<em>Hannah Henry, APRN-CPNP, is a provider at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-urgent-care-for-kids\">ProMedica Urgent Care for Kids</a> in Perrysburg.</em>",

    "Title": "5 Ways to Adjust to Daylight Savings Time",
    "Content": "It’s the time of the year to “spring forward” and that means we will all lose one hour of sleep this coming weekend.\n\nSleep might be the most underappreciated aspect of health. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine and the Sleep Research Society, “Sleeping less than seven hours per day is associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and frequent mental distress.”\n\nA fair amount of people consider themselves good sleepers and are fairly resilient to the hour loss. These people will recover quickly and feel back to normal within a couple days.\n\nFor some people, especially those who already have difficulty sleeping, the hour loss can be quite catastrophic. The time change impacts their daily activities and can lead to falling asleep at work and more concerning, while driving. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), an estimated one in 25 adult drivers (aged 18 or older) report having fallen asleep while driving in the previous 30 days.\n\nThere are a few tips that can help ease the transition to Daylight Savings Time.\n<ol>\n \t<li>On Saturday, get out of bed at a reasonable time.</li>\n \t<li>Get plenty of exercise, preferably outdoors.</li>\n \t<li>Avoid alcohol or caffeine that evening as they can disrupt sleep.</li>\n \t<li>Treat Saturday night like a work night and go to bed at your same regular time. Make sure your kids do the same!</li>\n \t<li>Start the day Sunday by again getting out of bed at a reasonable time. Sleeping in late can disrupt your sleeping pattern further.</li>\n</ol>\nIf you have a lot of difficulty adjusting to the time change, it might be sign of a sleep disorder. Sometimes people do not recognize they are not sleeping well until their bed partner mentions their considerable snoring or even paused breathing while sleeping. Other patients may struggle with falling asleep, insomnia or difficulty staying awake during the day.\n\nIf you have concerns about your sleep, share them with your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?Keyword=primary%20care\">primary care provider.</a>\n\nSleep well and know that Spring is coming!\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kathryn-boyle-williams-md-pulmonary-medicine\">Kathryn Williams, MD</a> is a ProMedica Physician specializing in pulmonary medicine and sleep medicine. </em>",

    "Title": "What Families Can Do to Stay Healthy This Winter",
    "Content": "This year, the holiday season will not only bring indulgent food and the colder weather we expect, but also more time without structured activities, traditional gatherings and more time at home. Perhaps families can find a silver lining of this extra togetherness and try some new healthy activities.\n<h2>Physical Activity</h2>\nPhysical activity is a first line \"treatment\" for so many common, chronic conditions, like high blood pressure, heart and vascular disease, diabetes, arthritis/joint pains, anxiety and depression.\n\nEven in the winter, there are some random, warmer days. Make sure you take advantage of those and get outside for walks and runs. In northwest Ohio, the Metroparks are great places for families to explore. Take evening walks in a neighborhood or in a downtown to enjoy the holiday lights and decorations.\n\nUtilize staircases when possible. This is a great way to get a short burst mini-workout throughout the day. Families can track the number of steps and total them to see how ‘high’ they climb. Note that if you’re just getting started with physical activity, use caution by taking stairs that have a hand-railing.\n\nExplore YouTube for workouts. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of workout videos available to stream at home. Workouts can range from 10 minutes to over an hour, and no equipment is needed for many of them. Just find a little open space and a towel (it is amazing how much sweat you can get going in a short amount of time). Families can keep each other accountable and share their favorite workouts.\n<h2>Healthy Eating</h2>\nHealthy eating is fundamental to preventing chronic diseases and fueling your body to function at its best. During the holidays, it can seem like there are cookies and candy and sweets everywhere. Consider little strategies to avoid them, like always having a strong mint or gum available. These can occupy your taste buds and help prevent you from a cycle of snacking.\n\nIt is important to know yourself and what works best for you when it comes to healthy eating. You may be a person who needs to have your meals planned and prepared ahead of time. You may be a person who appreciates a \"cheat day\" to motivate you to eat well the other six days. You might be someone who needs a more \"all or nothing\" approach and needs to completely cut carbs or sugars out of the diet, for example. Reflect on what you can see yourself doing, not just in the short term to lose that stubborn 10 pounds, but what can you see yourself still doing in one year, 10 years or even 20 years down the road.\n<h2>Holiday Meals</h2>\nEnjoy the holiday season and have your special holiday meal. The key is to limit the celebration to one meal that day and resume your family’s healthy eating when it is finished.\n\nImplementing some of these healthy strategies this holiday season will only add to the magic and happiness your family creates.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"3\" sm=\"3\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-7931 size-full\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/kevin-bingle-2148.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"650\" />\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"9\" sm=\"9\" sm=\"12\"]\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kevin-bingle-md-family-medicine\">Kevin Bingle, MD,</a> is a physician who specializes in family medicine at ProMedica Physicians Arrowhead Family Practice.</em>\n[/column]\n[/row]",

    "Title": "Understanding Bronchiolitis, A Common Infection in Children",
    "Content": "Bronchiolitis is an infection of the respiratory tract. It affects the small tubes or airways in the lungs. It can cause mucus to build up and can cause swelling in the lungs. It is an infection that causes symptoms similar to a cold, but can cause difficulty breathing or feeding in some cases.\n\nNearly a third of all children will have bronchiolitis before the age of two and is the most common cause of infant hospitalizations.\n\nUnderstanding what bronchiolitis is and its symptoms can help parents feel prepared when their little one gets sick. Here are some facts to know about this common infection.\n<h2>What causes it bronchiolitis?</h2>\nBronchiolitis is most often caused by a virus. The most common cause is the respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, but other viruses can cause it also. Some other viruses that may cause it include rhinovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus or human metapneumovirus.\n<h2>Is it contagious?</h2>\nMost viruses that cause bronchiolitis are contagious and can spread easily through the air when someone sneezes or coughs and germs can stay on hard surfaces such as hands, toys, door knobs, tissues and other surfaces for some time.\n<h2>Who is at risk?</h2>\nBronchiolitis often affects infants and children under the age of two because their airways are smaller and can more easily be blocked by the congestion and mucus. Children who were born prematurely, exposed to tobacco smoke, have a serious heart or lung condition, or have weakened immune systems have a higher risk for bronchiolitis.\n<h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>\nMany times bronchiolitis will start out looking like a cold. Your child may have a cough, runny nose, nasal congestion or a fever over 100.4F. These symptoms usually get better on their own. It is possible that symptoms could get worse and your child may have fast breathing, noisy breathing or have wheezing.\n<h2>How will my doctor know it is bronchiolitis?</h2>\nUsually no tests are needed. It is diagnosed based on the history of illness and physical exam. Your doctor may get a chest X-ray or take a sample of mucous from the nose to help with identifying the virus causing the illness or make sure nothing more serious is going on.\n<h2>How is it treated?</h2>\nMost cases don't need any specific medicine or treatment. There is no cure – the illness needs to run its course. Antibiotics are not needed for a simple case of bronchiolitis caused by a virus since antibiotics only work against bacterial infections.\n\nEasing your child’s symptoms is the focus of treatment. When your child has bronchiolitis, they need time to recover. Symptoms may last for a week or two, but sometimes it may take several weeks for symptoms to go away. Here are four things you can do at home to ease symptoms:\n<h3>1. Keep your child hydrated.</h3>\nOffer small amounts of fluids more frequently to keep your child hydrated.\n<h3>2. Use a cool mist vaporizer or humidifier.</h3>\nThis can help loosen mucous to help relieve cough and congestion. Be sure to clean it as recommended to prevent buildup of mold or bacteria.\n<h3>3. Ease nasal congestion.</h3>\nYou can try a non-medicated saline nose spray or drops and bulb suction or NoseFrida to clear secretions. This can be particularly helpful before feeding or sleeping.\n<h3>4. Reduce the fever as needed.</h3>\nIf your child is over 6 months old, you may use Tylenol or Motrin to reduce a fever. Be sure to follow the bottle instructions on how much and how often to give it to your child. Talk with your child’s provider if you have questions about using Tylenol or Motrin.\n<h2>When should you call a doctor?</h2>\nOften bronchiolitis is a mild illness that can be treated at home. However, there can be severe symptoms that require further treatments.\n\nSeek medical care right away if your child has:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Fast or shallow breathing or you can see the belly moving up and down quickly,</li>\n \t<li>Labored breathing with the muscles pulling at area below the ribs, between the ribs and/or the neck when the child is breathing in.</li>\n \t<li>Flared nostrils.</li>\n \t<li>Irritability they cannot be comforted.</li>\n \t<li>A poor appetite, not feeding well or won't wake up for feeds.</li>\n \t<li>Fewer wet diapers than usual.</li>\n \t<li>A blue color to the lips, tongue, or nails.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How can bronchiolitis be prevented?</h2>\nWashing hands is the best way to prevent spread of illness. Keep infants or children away from those who are sick with a cough or cold. Keep toys and surfaces clean, and avoid secondhand smoke exposure. Also be sure to maintain regular visits with your pediatrician for wellness checks.\n\n<em>Hannah Henry, APRN-CPNP, is a provider at ProMedica Urgent Care for Kids in Perrysburg.</em>",

    "Title": "5 Ways to Prep Your Body for a Healthier Winter",
    "Content": "The leaves are falling and there’s a chill in the air. And although it’s a beautiful time of year, you may have noticed some changes in your health as the seasons change. The falling leaves and dampness could affect those with sinus and allergy issues. The damp and cold could also affect those with lung conditions such as asthma. Have you noticed you’re feeling more groggy and achy? Joints could also feel achy with the change in seasons.\n\nYou’re probably busy getting your yard and home ready for winter, but what about preparing your health for winter? Here are some ideas on how to prep our bodies for the upcoming winter season.\n<h2>1. Fight the fatigue with healthy sleep habits.</h2>\nOur bodies naturally make a chemical called melatonin, which regulates when we’re asleep and when we’re awake. Melatonin is released in our body hours before sundown to help get us ready for sleep. When the sun is setting earlier in the fall and winter, our bodies produce melatonin much earlier in the day which can make us feel sleepy. Getting up early and trying to spend some time in the morning in the sunlight could help your body release melatonin later in the day to help with grogginess. Safe exposure to sunlight early in the day can affect the gland that makes melatonin and can help to delay the natural release of melatonin by this gland.\n\nAlso good sleep hygiene like getting to bed earlier and keeping a bedtime routine can be helpful to ensure we get enough rest so we don’t feel as tired. If you still feel tired or have a hard time adjusting, consider exercise in the morning to help fight daytime fatigue.\n<h2>2. Breathe easier by supporting your lung and sinus health.</h2>\nFalling leaves, cold air and damp weather could affect lung and sinus issues. Sinus congestion, sniffles, sinus pressure and allergies can flare up in the fall for some people. Also, those with lung issues such as asthma may be affected by the colder air.\n\nTry to limit time outside to avoid lung and sinus irritation and cover up the mouth and nose with a scarf while outside to protect from cold air. Diffusing or doing a steam of essential oils can help with lung support and essential oils such as eucalyptus and peppermint may help open nasal passages. These essential oils also have anti-microbial properties which could help reduce your risk for infections. The air inside can become dry when the heat is turned on causing our nose and sinuses to feel dry. There are many natural products available to lubricate the nose and soothe dry irritated nasal passages such as a neti pot/sinus rinse.\n<h2>3. Give your body a boost with nutrition.</h2>\nEating well any time of year is important for our overall health. In the fall and winter when we’re feeling cold, warming foods like soups and stews can warm us up and are easy our on digestive system. Adding nourishing, in-season produce, such as hard squashes, can provide your body with many vitamins, minerals, nutrients needed to keep your body and immune health strong.\n\nMushrooms could be included in the diet to support immune health by supporting our immune system’s non-specific defenses to colds. Not a fan of the taste of mushrooms? There are mushroom extract supplements for those that don’t want to eat them. These natural supplements can contain many mushrooms or single mushrooms like cordyceps. Other natural ways to boost our body are through the use of elderberry products. This deep purple-blue berry is full of anti-oxidants and has been suggested in studies to support our immune system and shorten the duration of the flu. Elderberries can be found in syrups, lozenges and also dried berries to add to your daily cup of tea.\n<h2>4. Reduce stress and stiffness with movement.</h2>\nExercise is good for joint health and can also help with stress levels. Joints that are feeling achy from the change in seasons may benefit from gentle exercise. Consider walking or chair yoga for gentle joint support. Exercise can also be used to help with stress levels. Stress can have many effects on our health including influencing hormones in the body which could contribute to our immune health.\n<h2>5. Ease tension and breathing with cupping.</h2>\nCupping is a natural therapy that is most commonly used for muscle tension, but can also be used to help with other conditions. Cupping over the lungs and diaphragm could be helpful over the winter months especially because it may help those with asthma or phlegm in their lungs take deeper breaths.\n\nThe technique of cupping involves the adhering of glass cups to the skin using suction. This technique has been used for thousands of years and recently the temporary marks left by cupping have been seen on professional athletes. Cupping is believed to increase circulation to an area and release tension. As circulation is increased and tension released, a red to purple colored mark is left on the skin. This mark can last for hours to days and will fade over time.\n\nLearn more about cupping in the video below.\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7FUCbQ3qsxc\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7682 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Kylie_Professional-Photo3-267x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "My child is sick. What if it's COVID-19?",
    "Content": "Welcome to the cold and flu season! The fall weather heralds in a whole host of recurring viruses and illnesses for our children and ourselves to be exposed to. In the midst of a worldwide pandemic, what’s a parent to do?\n\nFirst of all, let's take a deep breath. COVID-19 is an illness that generally only causes serious concerns for about 10% of children. Most children will present with mild symptoms (e.g., cough, body aches, fevers, fatigue, sore throat, runny noses) that may be indistinguishable from other illnesses, such as influenza.\n\nPeople at high risk for serious COVID-19 infections are the elderly and those with serious diseases that cause weakened immune systems or have chronic concerns with their lungs or heart.\n<h2>What is a true exposure to COVID-19?</h2>\nIf you or your child has spent more than 15 minutes with a person who is positive for COVID-19 and you were within 6 feet of distance during that 15 minutes, your child has had an exposure. (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html\">Learn more about close contact and exposure</a> from the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control.)\n<h2>How do I know if my child has COVID-19?</h2>\nYou may not! Remember, the most important thing is to treat the symptoms that your child has and make sure you are watching for symptoms that would indicate that they would need to seek a higher level of care. Stay in good communication with your child’s doctor for specific advice for your child. They may recommend that your child be seen for an office visit or be seen at an urgent care.\n\nLook for emergency warning signs for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, seek emergency medical care immediately (call 911 or go to the Emergency room):\n<ul>\n \t<li>Trouble breathing (increase in work of breathing, rapid or fast breathing).</li>\n \t<li>Persistent pain or pressure in the chest.</li>\n \t<li>New confusion.</li>\n \t<li>Inability to wake or stay awake.</li>\n \t<li>Bluish lips or face.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What do I do if my child’s sick?</h2>\nUnless your child has symptoms that require a higher level of care, stay home! The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) recommends that when people are sick, they need to stay home to prevent the spread of all diseases to others.\n\nHow long someone can spread the virus that causes COVID-19 is still under investigation. It’s possible for people to spread the virus for about two days before experiencing signs or symptoms and remain contagious for at least 10 days after signs or symptoms first appeared. So in general, once you notice symptoms of illness, you should isolate for 10 days after those symptoms to help prevent the spread of illness.\n\nRemember that even if your child is asymptomic, they could be contagious if they have COVID-19. So it’s important to quarantine and avoid contact with others if they’ve been exposed to COVID-19 and may be infected.\n<h2>How can I reduce my child’s chance of getting COVID-19?</h2>\nPrevention of illness is the key! Remind your child to keep social distance, wash their hands frequently, and keep their face covered as recommended. Be sure to clean and disinfect “high touch” surfaces daily. This helps prevent the spread of many of our illnesses including influenza and COVID-19. Make sure to get your seasonal flu shot to help decrease your risk of catching the flu. Flu shots should be given to all people over 6 months of age.\n\nTalk with your child’s primary care provider if you have questions about your child’s health or risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\n<em>Amy Spangler, CNP, is a certified nurse practitioner at </em><a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/urgentcare4kids\"><em>ProMedica Urgent Care for Kids</em></a><em>, located in Perrysburg.</em>\n\nFor the latest updates on COVID-19, please visit <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/COVID-19.aspx\">ProMedica' s Resource Center</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html\">CDC's website.</a>",

    "Title": "Natural Therapies to Reduce Stress",
    "Content": "Life is full of many stressors and this can leave us feeling tired and tense. What can we do to combat everyday stress? Here are a few ways that stress affects our health and how natural therapies may help.\n<h2>What happens when we stress?</h2>\nStress can impact our day but can also impact how we feel physically. Stress can put us into a “fight or flight” response where we are running on high alert at all times. Being in this state over time can wear us down and make us feel exhausted. Stress can also cause us to tense up and hold tension in our muscles and body.\n\nIt is also believed that stress can throw off our circadian rhythm which controls when we’re awake and when we’re asleep. Ever notice that when you’re stressed out you lie awake at night thinking about all the things you have to do? That’s stress throwing off your sleep pattern.\n<h2>What can we do to combat stress?</h2>\nStress is a part of everyday life so we often can’t avoid it. Stress can affect our lives and our health in many ways. Finding natural ways to handle the stress may help you to feel better overall.\n<h3>Enjoy Movement</h3>\nExercise can be helpful to release tension that’s built up in the body from stress. Taking a walk, bicycling or even parking a little further to get extra steps can help release tension. Doing an activity you enjoy can also help you to feel more relaxed. Making a phone call to a friend, reading a book, baking with the kids/grandkids are examples of activities you may enjoy and can help you de-stress.\n<h3>Just Breathe</h3>\nDeep breathing can calm and relax the body and mind for some people. Deep breathing helps get the body out of the “fight or flight” response and calms the body. Mental focus may also improve from deep breathing. These exercises can be done very easily and there are many apps on smartphones and smartwatches for deep breathing. A few minutes of deep breathing exercises especially before bedtime can help with sleep as well.\n<h3>Try Essential Oils</h3>\nHow about smelling a calming essential oil such as lavender before bed? Essential oils are believed to stimulate the limbic system in the brain, and may help lower blood pressure, calm the breathing rate and help the body to de-stress and relax in some people. Essential oils can be diffused in the air at home and there are also premixed blends and wearable essential oil jewelry to allow you to enjoy the benefits of essential oils on the go.\n<h3>Chinese Herbal Therapy</h3>\nIf you’ve tried several of these natural techniques and are still feeling stressed out, Chinese herbal therapy may be something to consider. Chinese herbal therapy involves the use of natural products such as plants, mushrooms, and minerals to address symptoms you’re experiencing. These natural products are often taken internally in a capsule, liquid or powder form.  Many of these herbs are considered to be adaptogens. Adaptogens may help the body handle physical and mental stressors. These adaptogenic herbs contain molecules that can help the body maintain homeostasis (aka its natural balanced state).\n\nAt the ProMedica Natural Wellness Shop, Chinese herbal therapy is performed by a practitioner licensed and trained in herbal therapy. Our licensed practitioner would conduct a consult with you to identify your health goals and evaluate whether Chinese herbal therapy is right for you.\n\nChinese herbal therapy can be used alone or in conjunction with acupuncture. Acupuncture can help with stress for some people by causing the body to release endorphins commonly known as “feel good hormones”.\n<h4>Learn more about Chinese herbal therapy in this video below:</h4>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOxaD7B1r5k\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nManaging stress is important for overall health and well-being. Natural therapies may help, but if stress is affecting your quality of life, consider talking with your healthcare provider.\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "Why Breastfeeding Matters",
    "Content": "If you’re like most people, you’ve probably had few conversations and read even fewer articles about breastfeeding. And, unless you are about to give birth in the next couple of weeks, you probably weren’t planning on reading about breastfeeding today.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nIn the past, you may have given little thought about breastfeeding, and that’s OK. It can be a sensitive topic for a lot of people. However, I encourage you to begin thinking of breastfeeding in a positive way. The benefits are so significant for moms and babies, that we can’t allow conversations around breastfeeding to be taboo or uncomfortable. Because of the benefits to mom and baby, breastfeeding should matter to all of us.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center; line-height: 1.4em; margin-top: 10px;\">Speak with a consultant at our Breastfeeding Warmline.\n<a href=\"tel:419-291-4577\">419-291-4577</a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/womens-services/Pages/maternity/lactation-services/default.aspx\"] Learn More About Lactation Services [/button]</p>\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h2>The benefits of breastfeeding are numerous.</h2>\n<h3>Breastfeeding:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Gives your baby a jump-start to life.</li>\n \t<li>Eases digestion (easier to digest breast milk vs. formula).</li>\n \t<li>Decreases rate of obesity, infections, diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and some childhood cancers.</li>\n \t<li>Decreases risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).</li>\n \t<li>Facilitates bonding between mom and baby.</li>\n \t<li>Improves brain and cognitive skills (thinking and reasoning).</li>\n \t<li>Quickens recovery and healing for mom (decreases bleeding and uterus returns to normal size sooner).</li>\n \t<li>Burns extra calories for mom, helping her to get back to her pre-pregnancy weight sooner.</li>\n \t<li>Reduces rates of breast and ovarian cancers in women who breastfeed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>So let’s talk a little more about some of the benefits of breastfeeding:</h2>\n<h3>Gives your baby a jump-start to life</h3>\nYour baby gets a jump-start to life because human milk is made up of exactly what a baby needs to thrive, and can be easier for a baby to digest than formula. Breast milk, unlike formula, changes during a feeding and over time, to meet the needs of a growing baby. For instance, at the beginning of a feeding the breast milk is made of water and sugar, but becomes fatty and higher in protein as the baby suckles. Over time, as the baby ages, the milk changes to meet developing and immediate needs too. For instance, when your baby is sick or exposed to an illness, milk changes to produce more illness-specific antibodies. Researchers believe the baby, through its saliva, passes cues to mom’s body, instructing it to produce milk containing more of what baby needs, including antibodies.\n<h3>Health benefits for baby</h3>\nBreastfeeding decreases the rates of obesity, infections, diabetes, asthma, and even some cancers for breastfed kids. Fewer medical conditions and complications mean fewer trips to the doctor or hospital. But, did you know that babies who are breastfed have a lower risk of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome)?\n<h3>Bonding between mom and baby</h3>\nBreastfeeding improves bonding between the mother and the baby. The benefits are even greater for babies who are born early or have a low birth weight!\n<h3>Improved cognitive skills</h3>\nBreastfed babies have improved thinking and reasoning skills later in life. Studies have shown that the children who were breastfed for at least 6 months had better problem-solving skills and were not as hyperactive at 3 years old. Breast milk contains the essential fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA or AA that promote the development of the brain and nervous system, thereby equipping breastfed babies with increased cognitive abilities.\n<h3>Benefits for mom</h3>\nDon’t worry; mom has almost as many immediate and long-term benefits as the baby! Right after the baby is born, putting the baby to the breast can help decrease bleeding and even help the uterus shrink back down to its normal size faster. Breastfeeding can burn extra calories per day helping a woman get back to her pre-pregnancy weight in a healthy way and a healthy period of time. We also know that rates of breast and ovarian cancers are lower in women who breastfeed! These women also have lower rates of diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nBy now, you have probably noticed my passion around breastfeeding. I want moms-to-be and families to feel comfortable talking about it. It is not always an easy thing to do, but health care providers are here to coach, educate and support women who are interested in breastfeeding. We have many resources we can share including some awesome stuff to read, contact information for lactation consultants, and more.\n\nMost women make the decision on how they will feed their child before pregnancy or very early in pregnancy, so now is the time to have those conversations with the people around you. If you are newly pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, please start the conversation with your OB/GYN early, so that you can get as much information as possible to set you and your baby up for success.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7805 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Kellen-Goldschmidt-MD_jpg-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kellen-goldschmidt-md-obstetrics\">Kellen Goldschmidt, MD,</a> is an obstetrician/gynecologist with ProMedica Physicians practicing at <a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/perrysburgwomens\">Levis Commons</a> in Perrysburg.

    "Title": "Is it time for your teen to see a gynecologist?",
    "Content": "If you’re the parent of a teenage daughter, you may be wondering if it’s time for her first visit to the gynecologist. Some parents may find the thought of taking their teen to a gynecologist uncomfortable, awkward, or pre-mature, but the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that girls have their first gynecologic visit between the ages of 13 and 15.\n<h2>What happens at the first visit?</h2>\nWhile 13 to 15 may seem young for the first visit, it is the perfect time to make sure your daughter is healthy and physically developing as she should. The first appointment is about establishing rapport and a healthy doctor/patient relationship; the goal being open communication and creating a baseline for care.\n[row]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nAmong the topics the gynecologist may discuss with your teen are: smoking, drug and alcohol abuse, unprotected sex, puberty, hygiene, sexually transmitted diseases/infections, contraception, exercise, and mental health. And, unless your daughter is doing something that could hurt her or someone else, the private conversation remains strictly confidential.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ready for a visit?</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"#form-appointment\"] Request an Appointment [/button]</p>\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\nTypically, the first gynecologic visit for a teen doesn’t involve an internal pelvic exam or pap smear, unless the teen is sexually active. Many gynecologists will just do a regular health exam, ask health related questions, take the teen’s vitals (like height, weight, blood pressure), discuss familiarity with her breasts, and talk about her physical development. During the first visit, the doctor may ask you (parents or guardian) to be in the examination room at the beginning of the appointment to provide support, but will likely ask you to leave when it’s time for exams or more personal questions.\n<h2>Why does a teen need a gynecologist?</h2>\nAs girls grow into teens and teens into young adults, it's important that they get the right health care, including yearly checkups that focus on their reproductive system. These annual visits increase the chances of detecting and diagnosing small issues before they become major health concerns.\n\nIt is highly recommended that your daughter visit a gynecologist if she is having sex (or plans to soon) or having problems with her period. Here are some of the many reasons why a parent and their child may decide that the time is right for a first visit.\n<h3>She has early, late or irregular periods.</h3>\nIn the United States, most girls start their period between 12 and 13 years of age. If your daughter’s first period doesn’t come between 12 and 13, you may consider an appointment with a gynecologist. If she has developed breasts and pubic hair, but has not had her first period by age 15, she should definitely see a gynecologist. Once her period starts, if it is irregular after more than a year or two, she should see a gynecologist.\n<h3>She has exceptionally painful cramps or heavy periods.</h3>\nIf your daughter has pain and cramps that keep her from enjoying her normal daily activities and are not easily managed by over-the-counter medication, she may need to visit a gynecologist. Or, if she experiences a heavy period, one that lasts longer than a week or soaks more than 1 to 2 pads in an hour, she needs to see a gynecologist.\n<h3>You want to protect her against the human papillomavirus (HPV):</h3>\nYour teen should also receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine if she did not receive it between the ages of 11 and 12. The human papillomavirus is a very common sexually transmitted infection and nearly all cervical cancer is caused by this virus. The HPV vaccine is a series of two injections (if given before 15), given at least six months apart, which serves as protection against the virus. The HPV vaccine is more effective if given before your teen becomes sexually active; however, it is still recommended if she is already sexually active.\n<h3>She’s sexually active.</h3>\nAs soon as your daughter becomes sexually active, she should begin receiving regular sexually transmitted disease screenings and vaginal health exams. A report by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) states that over half of U.S. teens have had sexual intercourse by age 18. Therefore, it’s important that they practice safe sex, stay healthy, be informed and educated. If your teen is sexually active, birth control options can be discussed. A visit to the gynecologist is encouraged if she has had any form of sex (e.g., vaginal, oral, anal), sexual contact, or if she has been having sex and missed her last period.\n<h3>She may have a disease or infection.</h3>\nSymptoms like stomach pain, fever and fluid coming from her vagina that is yellow, gray, or green with a strong smell are signs of a serious condition called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) that requires immediate treatment. Or, if there are signs of a yeast infection or sexually transmitted disease, call the doctor right away. A delay in treatment could be harmful to your daughter.\n<h2>How can you and your daughter prepare for her first visit?</h2>\n<h3>Talk with your daughter to set expectations and ease fears.</h3>\nLet her know that you will be with her during the first part of the visit, but at some point, you will be asked to leave the room so the doctor can have a more private conversation with her. If she would prefer you to stay in the room during the exam or throughout the entire visit, that is perfectly acceptable, too. Explain that if she is not sexually active, the visit is often a conversation and does not always involve a pelvic exam. To further ease fears, you may see if the doctor is willing to conduct a telehealth visit (via telephone or video), before scheduling the in-person visit. During the telehealth visit, your daughter can meet the doctor and ask questions that will ease her mind prior to going to the office.\n<h3>Share what will happen during the visit.</h3>\nLet her know that it is safe to talk with the doctor or provider about private matters so she can get the best possible care. She can have her mom, sibling or a friend stay in the room with her during the visit if that would make her more comfortable. She can ask all the questions she wants so that she understands what is going to happen to her. Inform her that a general physical exam, which includes height, weight and blood pressure measurements, will be conducted. And, the provider may perform a brief external pelvic exam as well as a breast exam. A female nurse or assistant will also be in the room if an exam is necessary, and if she prefers, she can ask to see a female doctor.\n<h3>Ask the doctor for reading materials and resources.</h3>\nReading materials, diagrams, pictures, articles and other resources may be helpful for your daughter. She may be more comfortable reading about a gynecologic visit, than talking with you about the particulars. So, contact your doctor to see what resources she recommends for your daughter prior to her visit.\n\nIntroducing your daughter to a gynecologist at the right time will help her understand the importance of self-care and building a relationship with a healthcare provider. That’s something that will help her stay healthy now and in the future.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7805 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Kellen-Goldschmidt-MD_jpg-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kellen-goldschmidt-md-obstetrics\">Kellen Goldschmidt, MD,</a> is an obstetrician/gynecologist with ProMedica Physicians practicing at <a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/perrysburgwomens\">Levis Commons</a> in Perrysburg.

    "Title": "Are you experiencing unusually painful periods?",
    "Content": "Being on your period comes with uncomfortable side effects, the most common one being menstrual cramps. While some cramping is normal, painful periods are not. Unfortunately, many girls and women live with menstrual pain without knowing that it’s very treatable.\n\nMenstrual pain, also known as dysmenorrhea, often presents as cramps and pelvic pain. But it may also include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches and muscle cramps. Menstrual pain is quite common: 50-90% of women have painful periods. Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is also associated with menstrual pain and increases with the severity of period pain.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nJust because menstrual pain is common, doesn’t mean it’s normal. Painful periods is the leading cause of recurrent short-term school absenteeism for young girls. It can cause individuals to stay home from work or school, miss planned outings or engagements or make it difficult to participate in daily activities. When painful periods interfere with your life, it’s time to seek help.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Painful periods?\nDr. Brodsky can help.</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"#form-appointment\"] Request an Appointment [/button]</p>\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\nMore often than not, menstrual pain can be treated with over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications. If a stronger medication is needed, your doctor may prescribe something for you. The goals of treatment include symptom relief and a return to normal activities. If your symptoms are not minimized and your body does not respond to anti-inflammatory medications after three to six months of treatment, then you should visit your gynecologist for further medical evaluation.\n\nMany girls do try over-the-counter medications. In fact, 25% of young girls use pain medication monthly, without having seen a physician to investigate the pain. If you or your daughter are experiencing chronic period pain, talking with your doctor is an important step in ruling out other causes of the pain.\n\nMenstrual pain may result from other conditions or causes, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Endometriosis:</strong> tissue that normally grows inside the uterus (womb) is abnormally growing outside the uterus.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Ovarian cysts: </strong>sac-like structures, filled with a liquid or semisolid substance, are present within the ovary.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Polyps:</strong> mass of tissue that develops on the inside wall of the uterus, cervix or stomach.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Uterine fibroids:</strong>benign tumors in the uterus (womb).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Adenomyosis:</strong> the tissue that normally lines the uterus (endometrial tissue) grows into the muscular wall of the uterus.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Infections:</strong> the invasion and multiplication of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites that are not normally present within the body.</li>\n</ul>\nEndometriosis is the most common secondary cause of painful periods. To diagnose endometriosis, your doctor performs an evaluation, which often includes a detailed medical history, a pelvic exam and a pelvic ultrasound. Treatment may range from medications to surgery (a last resort). Individuals should consult with their doctor to decide the best treatment option for them.\n\nPainful periods aren’t something that anyone should put up with, especially when it’s interfering with your ability to participate in and enjoy daily life. Menstrual pain is treatable, so don’t ignore the pain and symptoms. Discuss your pain with your family and healthcare providers so that you can get started on a treatment plan.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7799 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Brodsky-Burton-MD_cropped-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Burton Brodsky, MD, is an obstetrician/gynecologist with ProMedica Physicians practicing at <a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/perrysburgwomens\">Levis Commons</a> in Perrysburg. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/burton-brodsky-md-obstetrics\">View his provider profile.</a></em>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n<hr />\n\n<h5>Watch Dr. Goldschmidt talk about IUDs in a recent Ask the Expert on 13abc:</h5>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vE0z41QkhZY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<div id=\"form-appointment\">\n\n<hr />\n\n</div>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Accepting NEW Patients: Schedule an Appointment Today!</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Call <a id=\"ct19_0\" href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/ct/35511/p-0005/Bct/l-01aa/l-01aa:75/ct19_0/1?sid=TV2%3ABCNn9EEip\" name=\"tel__567_585_0265\">567-585-0265 </a>or complete the form below to have our office contact you about a new patient appointment.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"aoform-script-2995aa0f-e88c-4f11-a1ef-01bd30629796:d-0001\">!function(o,t,e,a){o._aoForms=o._aoForms||[],o._aoForms.push(a);var n=function(){var o=t.createElement(e);o.src=(\"https:\"==t.location.protocol?\"https://\":\"http://\")+\"yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/content/form_embed.js\",o.async=!0;for(var a=t.getElementsByTagName(e)[0],n=a.parentNode,c=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),r=!1,s=0;s<c.length;s++){if(c[s].getAttribute(\"src\")==o.getAttribute(\"src\"))r=!0;}r?typeof(_aoFormLoader)!=\"undefined\"?_aoFormLoader.load({id:\"2995aa0f-e88c-4f11-a1ef-01bd30629796:d-0001\",accountId:\"35511\",domain:\"yourhealth.promedica.org\",isTemp:false,noStyle:false,prefill:false}):\"\":n.insertBefore(o,a)};window.attachEvent?window.attachEvent(\"onload\",n):window.addEventListener(\"load\",n,!1),n()}(window,document,\"script\",{id:\"2995aa0f-e88c-4f11-a1ef-01bd30629796\",accountId:\"35511\",domain:\"yourhealth.promedica.org\",isTemp:false,noStyle:false,prefill:false});</script>",

    "Title": "Two Ways to Reclaim Your Sleep",
    "Content": "A good night’s sleep: It’s foundational to health, but often overlooked. If you’re struggling with getting enough sleep, you may find yourself feeling tired, irritable and unproductive. Two factors – reducing stress and creating structure – can be instrumental in helping you reclaim sleep. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/geoffrey-rulong-md-pediatric-sleep-medicine\">Geoffrey Rulong, MD,</a> a pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist with ProMedica Physicians, explains why.\n<h2>Try to Reduce Your Stress</h2>\nStress has a way of creeping in to many aspects of our lives, especially our sleep habits. And right now, it can be difficult to manage.\n\n“We’re all having a lot of stress regarding the uncertainty in our lives right now,” says Dr. Rulong. “We’re worried about getting sick, we’re worried about our jobs. This leads to stress and anxiety, which can lead to insomnia or difficulty sleeping.”\n\nAs much as possible, try to reduce the stress in your life. Dr. Rulong suggests making it a priority to have some time each day for yourself.\n\n“This can definitely be challenging, especially if you have little kids, but you need to set aside some time for physical activity, enjoying a hobby, talking to friends or family members, or some sort of outlet to reduce stress in your life,” he explains.\n<h2>Create a Daytime and Sleep Routine</h2>\nLetting go of daily routine can sometimes feel relaxing and freeing, like during a vacation or at the start of retirement. But having some structure plays an important role in our health and managing our stress levels.\n\nAnd it’s not just about sticking to a bedtime. It’s about our daytime routines, too.\n\n“Structure is very helpful for sleep and reducing anxiety because the stress is taken away because we know what is coming next. It allows us to take control of our lives, and right now we may feel like we don’t have control,” explains Dr. Rulong. “Try being consistent with your daytime schedule – schedule a time to wake up, meal times, work time, socializing time, physical activity. Really try to have order to your daily routine.”\n\nFor those with insomnia, consistency around sleep is especially important. Most adults require 7-8 hours of sleep per night. Dr. Rulong recommends setting an alarm for 7-8 hours after you go to bed, then getting up when that alarm goes off. Laying in bed in the morning can affect your sleep pattern.\n\n“Another thing you can do is minimize napping,” advises Dr. Rulong. “If you had a poor night’s sleep the night before, you can try to nap for about 30 minutes, but really try to limit it to no more than that in the morning and early afternoon.”\n\nRemember that you don’t have to do too much, too soon. Find small ways to work toward reducing stress and building a daily routine. Little by little, you’ll find your way to a healthier sleep pattern.",

    "Title": "Delivering a Baby During COVID-19",
    "Content": "Brandon and Alyssa Sehlhorst didn’t know what to pack in their hospital bag. Like most parents, the upcoming birth of their first child was surrounded with questions. But their unknowns were heightened from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“We wanted to make sure we had everything,” explained Alyssa. “We couldn’t have family bring things in to the hospital, we didn’t know if the cafeteria would be open at the hospital. We had two pieces of luggage – it looked like we were moving in!”\n\nThankfully, neither of them were infected with the COVID-19 virus, but concerns about the virus and adjusting to precautions gave them a different birth experience than they were expecting.\n<h2>A Different Birth Experience</h2>\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Smith-Sehlhorst.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-7742 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Smith-Sehlhorst.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1440\" /></a>\n[/column]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nOn March 19, Brandon and Alyssa welcomed their son Smith Parker Sehlhorst at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/toledo-hospital/Pages/default.aspx\">ProMedica Toledo Hospital.</a>\n\n“We didn’t know the baby’s gender and one of the things I got invested in before COVID-19 was the moment where I would run out and tell our parents the gender of our baby. That was something I was looking forward to as a dad,” said Brandon.\n\n“Looking back I don’t feel like I got robbed of that moment. They gave me the opportunity to announce it in the room and there was so much energy. We brought a stereo and played ‘Push It’. The doctors and team were dancing and we genuinely felt like family,\" he said. \"The actual delivery process exceeded our expectations; the labor and delivery team was phenomenal.”\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\nShannon Secor, MSN, RNC, director of the postpartum unit at ProMedica Toledo Hospital, understands how COVID-19 impacts patients and their expectations. “We know in these challenging times that a patient’s birth experience may not be what was envisioned, but we are committed to making it the best it can be while delivering safe and quality care,” she said. “We have two patients to keep in mind – the mother and the newborn – so it’s important that we look at this from every angle.”\n\nTo reduce the potential spread of COVID-19, many changes have taken place in hospitals – some changes are behind the scenes while others are more visible to patients.\n\n“Our visitor guidelines have changed and we are prescreening our patients coming in for elective inductions or c-sections. This allows us to develop a treatment plan and get them to the designated hospital if screened positive for COVID-19,” explained Secor. “Additionally, we are encouraging early discharge if both mom and baby are medically stable. This allows them to return home to get back to practicing the state’s Stay at Home order and decrease possible exposure.”\n\nThe hospital is working to protect hospital staff as well by diligently adhering to the personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand hygiene requirements. The hospital has also turned one of the older units into a shower area for employees who prefer to shower and change clothes prior to going home to their families.\n\n“Safety is our main concern,” states Secor. “This is an unprecedented and unique time for all of us. We have obligations to both our staff and our patients to assure that everyone stays healthy and safe.”\n\nWith all of these changes, Secor says that education and setting patients expectations before delivery is key. “We have been working as a system with our providers to set guidelines on delivery and postpartum care,” she said. “These guidelines are the same across the system so there is no confusion on who is doing what.”\n<h2>Finding Support in Others and Each Other</h2>\nBecause Brandon and Alyssa were at the forefront of COVID-19 restrictions in Ohio, the answers they needed weren’t always available. “We had a lot of questions about restrictions and family, what would happen when we left the hospital. We had to keep asking questions in terms of preparation and isolation with our family, but there weren’t solid answers,” said Alyssa.\n\n[row]\n\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n“We didn’t know what to expect because this is our first,” explained Brandon. “When you put two people who have never had a baby before in a house during quarantine, it’s really taxing.\n\nLike many people during this time, Brandon and Alyssa turned to technology to make connections virtually, finding support in the local Toledo Moms group, baby websites, family members and friends who have also recently had babies.\n\nThe couple has also tried to find the positives despite the challenges.\n\n“I get to be home during this time,” said Brandon. “Otherwise, I would have only taken a week or two paternity leave. The silver lining is I get time with my wife and son by working at home that I would not have otherwise received.”\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sehlhorst-Family.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-7741 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sehlhorst-Family.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1440\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n“We have close friends who just had a baby and we’ve been talking to them a lot,” Alyssa said. “We told them that this is the time to look at the positives and hold on to each other. There is some light with all of this.”\n\n“We were always planning on a date night in the first week or so to set the tone for our marriage and that our relationship comes first. Your relationship is the reason this little human exists in the first place,” Brandon explained. “Unfortunately, we weren’t able to do that, but we’ve done puzzles, we’ve gone on walks, we’ve gone on Starbucks drive-thru dates, and we’ve driven an hour just to get out. You have to create that time for you and your spouse. And that’s probably true without COVID-19, too.”\n<h2>Looking to the Future</h2>\nAlthough Smith is a healthy baby, his parents can’t help but think of the ways in which COVID-19 will impact his experiences and development.\n\n“First time parents especially are sensitive to germs and don’t want to get the baby sick, so they avoid taking him out in public, but the new coronavirus brings this to a whole new level,” said Brandon.\n\nAlyssa added, “Babies are constantly growing and developing from their environment – what does it look like when they can’t experience other voices? How can we incorporate family? What unexpected challenges may we face?”\n\nHealthcare professionals are also considering the impact COVID-19 has on their services, both now and long-term. In addition to safety precautions, ProMedica is finding convenient ways to deliver patient care and education. For example, utilizing <a href=\"https://mychart.promedica.org/MyChart/Authentication/Login?\">ProMedica MyChart,</a> ProMedica’s patient portal, to accept prescription refill requests, message patients and have a virtual doctor’s visit.\n\n“This has been a time for teamwork and collaboration across the hospitals, physician offices and disciplines, such as obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics, neonatology and infectious disease,” says Secor. “We’ll continue to adjust our care as more literature on this virus becomes available, using evidence to bring safe and meaningful experiences to our patients.”\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stay up-to-date with COVID-10 updates and resources.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/COVID-19.aspx\"] Go to ProMedica's Resource Center [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "5 Natural Ways to Support Immune Health",
    "Content": "Your immune system is your body’s defense mechanism against bacteria and germs that cause illness. With cold and flu season upon us, you might be thinking about what you can do to boost and support this important function. Fortunately, there are several simple things you can do. These natural strategies are good for your overall health and may help boost your immunity, too. Remember to always consult with your healthcare provider before making any significant changes in diet, supplements, vitamins, or exercise.\n<h2>1. Get a good night’s sleep.</h2>\nSleep is important for our health for many reasons and not getting enough quality sleep has been linked to many different diseases, including <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/body-and-conditions/sleep-and-heart-health/\">heart disease. </a>Lacking sleep could also impact our immune health by disrupting hormonal signals in the body. These hormones do many things throughout the body and some are linked with immune system function. Following a good bedtime routine and limiting screen time close to bedtime (e.g., TV, cell phone, computer) can help you to fall asleep easier.\n<h2>2. Manage your stress.</h2>\nStress is something many people experience frequently. Stress can disrupt hormone signals in our body just like lack of sleep. If not managed well, it can be detrimental to our overall health and cause physical symptoms such as chronic headaches or upset stomach. Finding healthy ways to manage stress can help the immune system and help with overall well-being. Exercise, meditation and participating in hobbies/activities you enjoy are all good ways to manage stress naturally.\n<h2>3. Ramp up your nutrition.</h2>\nWhat we eat is fuel for the cells of our body. Eating foods like fruits and vegetables rich in Vitamin C and anti-oxidants can naturally boost our immune system. Citrus fruits, tomatoes, red bell peppers, broccoli and Brussels sprouts are good sources of Vitamin C. Some anti-oxidant rich foods are berries, chocolate, spices and herbs.\n<h2>4. Protect your gut health.</h2>\nOur digestive system, or gut, digests the food and beverages we consume to produce the fuel or energy for our body. Many health fields believe that gut health is vital to our overall health. A large part of our immune system is found in our gut so gut health is vital to the health of our immune system. Diet and eating small meals can help support our gut. Also pro-biotic supplements and pro-biotic rich foods (such as sauerkraut and yogurt) support the “good bacteria” that live in our gut and play a role in our immune system. <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/wellness/4-ways-to-keep-your-gut-healthy/\">Learn more about gut bacteria and keeping your gut healthy.</a>\n<h2>5. Consider vitamins and supplements.</h2>\nAfter pursuing diet and lifestyle changes, the addition of vitamins and supplements can be a safe addition to your natural wellness routine when used appropriately. There are many vitamins and supplements widely available to support many health concerns. Check with your healthcare provider before deciding to start any vitamins or supplements. Here are a few examples of some vitamins and supplements that could be used for immune support:\n<h3>Vitamin D</h3>\nVitamin D is essential for our body to use calcium to support bone health. It has also recently been shown to support the immune system by supporting gut health.\n<h3>Elderberry</h3>\nElderberry is a small dark berry rich in anti-oxidants. In research studies, elderberry has been shown to have anti-microbial fighting effects against bacteria and also the virus that causes Influenza A and Influenza B.\n<h3>Chinese Herbal Therapy</h3>\nChinese herbal therapy involves the use of several natural substances such as plants to keep the immune system and overall body in balance.\n\nKeep your immune system and body working efficiently this cold and flu season!\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7682 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Kylie_Professional-Photo3-267x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "Could Your Winter Blues Be Depression?",
    "Content": "With shorter days and colder temperatures, some people find themselves feeling a bit down during the winter season. If you’re tired, stressed or feeling emotionally heavy, how do you know if it’s the winter blues or something more, like depression?<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/mahmood-darr-md-internal-medicine\"> Mahmood Darr, MD,</a> an internal medicine physician with ProMedica Physicians, addresses depression and potential signs that you may need to talk with your doctor.\n<h4>Understanding depression</h4>\nIt helps to understand that there are two types of depression: endogenous depression and reactive depression. Endogenous depression is due to serotonin imbalances in the brain, and tends to be persistent regardless of the season or a person’s short-term circumstances. Many times, it’s hereditary and occurs genetically in families.\n\nReactive depression, on the other hand, has a shorter lifespan. “This can happen as a result of bereavement, employment problems, marital problems or relationship issues,” explained Dr. Darr. “You can link up the symptoms to an event that happened and explore previous events in a person’s life to see if the symptoms also occurred at those times.”\n\nThen, there are those times when we just feel down. This may happen once or twice a year at a time that reminds a person of a significant life event, such as the loss of a spouse or a parent. Or, they experience seasonal affective disorder (SAD) due to the change in light exposure, temperature variations and change in lifestyle from season to season.\n\n“Most people have some element of SAD,” said Dr. Darr. If someone who finds gardening to be therapeutic can’t do that in the winter, or they can’t get in their walks that keep them happy, not being able to do those things can get them feeling down.”\n<h4>Treating the blues vs. depression</h4>\nIf you’re just feeling down or heavy, Dr. Darr recommends starting with self-care. Getting good sleep, eating healthy and reaching out to your friends and support systems are essential in difficult times. For SAD, specifically, regulating sleep with a consistent schedule or with the help of melatonin may be beneficial. For reactive depression, therapy, understanding the situation and using coping mechanisms may help.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone has the support structure to help in difficult times.\n\n“Often these things aren’t present this day and age. Families are far apart, so people don’t have that close-knit community. Loneliness is a big factor, especially with the elderly,” said Dr. Darr. “If you have a good support system and talking with them helps, then use them. You don’t always have to go to your doctor. But if you’re embarrassed or you don’t have anyone to talk to, then talk to your doctor.”\n\nEven if you have a strong support network, Dr. Darr recommends seeing your doctor if your daily life and ability to function is affected.\n\n“The first symptoms of depression include a feeling of excessive fatigue, losing interest in the things that you normally enjoy, taking days off, calling in sick, not taking care of your children the way you used to or you’re not paying attention to your family or your spouse,” explained Dr. Darr.\n\nEating and sleep can also be affected. “If you’re depressed, you may be sleeping excessively or you may not be sleeping well,” Dr. Darr said. “Often you see people have very shallow sleep where they wake up a couple of times at night or they wake up in the morning and do not have their usual energy.”\n\nPeople with depression may hurt themselves through an unhealthy use of over-the-counter medications or by making superficial cuts on their body. As with many conditions, there are varying degrees of depression and a screening by a healthcare provider can help determine the best course of treatment. However, if someone is experiencing destructive thoughts toward themselves or others, it’s a sign that urgent help is needed.\n\nThe key question is if the way you are feeling is affecting your daily life.\n\n“I would recommend talking to your doctor if it’s affecting your functionality,” said Dr. Darr. “If you’re thinking ‘I have to do something about this; I can’t function, I’m going to lose my job,’ it’s time to see a professional who is used to seeing these types of cases.”",

Kellen Goldschmidt, MD, an obstetrician/gynecologist with ProMedica Physicians, explains five facts about IUDs.\n\n<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17.5px; font-weight: bold;\">1. IUDs are effective.</span>\n\n“The IUDs are among the most effective options we have at preventing unintended pregnancies,” said Dr. Goldschmidt. “For young women, they can be even more effective than getting their tubes tied.”\n\nIn fact, during the first year of IUD use, fewer than one out of 100 women will get pregnant. And overtime, IUDs are 20 times more effective than traditional methods like birth control pills, the patch or the ring.\n<h4>2. There are hormonal and nonhormonal options.</h4>\nAn IUD works mainly be preventing the fertilization of the egg.\n\n“There are both hormonal/progesterone and nonhormonal/copper options,” explained Dr. Goldschmidt. “The progestin in the hormonal IUD thickens the mucus in the cervix and makes it hard for sperm to enter the uterus and reach the egg. The copper in the copper IUD interferes with the sperm’s ability to move. Since the sperm and the egg never meet, the IUD is not aborting a fertilized egg.”\n<h4>3. IUDs can be removed at any time.</h4>\nIUDS are a form of long-acting birth control that can stay in place for years, making it a very convenient option for women. And, it’s reversible.\n\n“The device is placed in the uterus at the doctor’s office and if someone decides they want to get pregnant or have the device removed, they can take it out at any time,” said Dr. Goldschmidt.\n<h4>4. Changes with your period may occur from an IUD.</h4>\n“When a woman uses an IUD, changes in menstrual bleeding are normal and are not harmful,” assured Dr. Goldschmidt.\n\nWith the copper IUD, painful periods and bleeding may increase during the first months of use. Hormonal IUDs may cause spotting, more days of bleeding and heavier bleeding in the first months of use. However, over time, the amount of menstrual bleeding and the length of your menstrual period usually decreases. Menstrual pain also usually decreases. For some women using a hormonal IUD, menstrual bleeding stops completely.\n\n“A small number of women may also experience headaches, nausea, breast tenderness and mood changes,” said Dr. Goldschmidt. “Some common concerns with the IUD are the risk of the IUD poking into or through the uterus, but this complication is a very uncommon event.”\n<h4>5. IUDs do not prevent STDs.</h4>\nWhile IUDs are a very safe and effective form of birth control, they do not prevent sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). “In order to prevent STDs, female or male condoms are still recommended while using an IUD,” advised Dr. Goldschmidt.\n\n<em>Still have questions about IUDs and long-acting, reversible birth control? <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/-/media/For-Patients/faq184.pdf?dmc=1&amp;ts=20191118T2119094995\">Read these FAQs</a> from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.</em>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h5>Watch Dr. Goldschmidt talk about IUDs in a recent Ask the Expert on 13abc:</h5>\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vE0z41QkhZY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" id=\"aoform-script-2995aa0f-e88c-4f11-a1ef-01bd30629796:d-0001\">!function(o,t,e,a){o._aoForms=o._aoForms||[],o._aoForms.push(a);var n=function(){var o=t.createElement(e);o.src=(\"https:\"==t.location.protocol?\"https://\":\"http://\")+\"yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/content/form_embed.js\",o.async=!0;for(var a=t.getElementsByTagName(e)[0],n=a.parentNode,c=document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\"),r=!1,s=0;s<c.length;s++){if(c[s].getAttribute(\"src\")==o.getAttribute(\"src\"))r=!0;}r?typeof(_aoFormLoader)!=\"undefined\"?_aoFormLoader.load({id:\"2995aa0f-e88c-4f11-a1ef-01bd30629796:d-0001\",accountId:\"35511\",domain:\"yourhealth.promedica.org\",isTemp:false,noStyle:false,prefill:false}):\"\":n.insertBefore(o,a)};window.attachEvent?window.attachEvent(\"onload\",n):window.addEventListener(\"load\",n,!1),n()}(window,document,\"script\",{id:\"2995aa0f-e88c-4f11-a1ef-01bd30629796\",accountId:\"35511\",domain:\"yourhealth.promedica.org\",isTemp:false,noStyle:false,prefill:false});</script>",

    "Content": "Dog owners know that nothing warms the heart like furry dog cuddles or a happy wagging tail. But new research suggests that dogs not only warm the heart, they help protect it. A systematic review recently published in the <a href=\"https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554\">American Heart Association's publication \"Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes\"</a> found that in several studies, dog ownership was associated with a reduced risk of death from all causes, and cardiovascular death in particular.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jeffrey-moore-md-pediatric-cardiology\">Jeffrey Moore, MD,</a> with ProMedica Physicians Pediatric Cardiology, isn't surprised by the findings. As a pediatric cardiologist and owner of two dogs, he sees the benefits that man's best friend provides, particularly among older adults.\n\n\"When you get older and get simple viral illnesses, they become a big deal. Maintaining good health just in general is going to help you fight off those infections. If you're in a better state of healthy, because you've led a healthy lifestyle for years up to that, you have more reserve to fight off those infections and you simply do better,\" Dr. Moore explained.\n\nDogs can often help their owners stay active with regular walking, but in addition offer mental and emotional benefits that play a large role in overall health.\n\n\"The social angle is extremely important because companionship is so extremely important for general health and mental health,\" he said. \"When you look at older people who are more likely to be isolated and therefore more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression and other things that can have long-term health consequences, dogs play a pivotal role because they are the perfect companion.\"\n\nBeyond companionship, trained therapy dogs can do amazing things like assist individuals having a seizure by flipping them over and helping to protect the individual's head. At <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/toledo-childrens-hospital/pages/default.aspx\">ProMedica Toledo Children's Hospital</a>, therapy dogs visit the children to provide emotional support and brighten their day.\n\n\"It's amazing how you see kids just get better regardless of what they're in the hospital for when they have a better state of mind,\" said Dr. Moore.\n\n<em>Does your dog keep you healthy?

    "Title": "What's causing your joint pain?",
    "Content": "Joint pain is an extremely common condition that affects millions of people, but not all joint pain is the same. Understanding the root cause of your pain starts with knowing more about how your joints work and how they may be injured.\n\nJoints form connections between your bones and are found throughout your body. There are multiple joints in your body including your knees, hips and shoulders, but there are also joints in your wrist, hands, feet and back. Joints are made of bones coming together and are supported by tendons, ligaments and muscles, with cartilage to separate them and support motion.\n\nMany conditions lead to joint pain and difficulty with function. The most common is osteoarthritis, which is a wear and tear disease. Sprains, strains, bursitis, gout and other injuries or diseases can also cause issues. Various joints can be affected throughout the body, but the knee joint is the most common complaint, followed by the shoulder and hip.\n\nPain in a joint may be acute, meaning it lasts for a few weeks after an injury such as a sprain or a ligament tear. This can lead to short-term swelling and pain and can negatively affect your daily activities and quality of life.\n\nJoint pain may also accumulate over time and become painful from osteoarthritis and wearing away of the cartilage and surrounding tissues. This chronic condition can cause long-term pain (months or years) and difficulty with the functioning of the joint. It may change the way that the joint moves in the body with activities as simple as walking. These changes in the joint can even lead to dysfunction in other areas of the body, such as worsened back pain from knee pain and osteoarthritis that causes you to walk differently.\n\nTypical initial treatment when you have joint pain consists of short-term rest, ice, physical therapy and medications such as Tylenol or anti-inflammatories. If your joint pain continues or worsens, it is recommended that you see your healthcare provider for further evaluation of the cause of your pain and possible treatment options that can help with your pain and function.\n\nIf you have extreme pain, sudden inflammation and warmth of the area, deformity of the joint or can no longer move the joint, urgent evaluation may be needed.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[row]\n[column md=\"2\" sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Szepiela.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7555 size-medium\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Szepiela-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Dr. Szepiela is board certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation, sports medicine and has a specialized interest in spinal intervention.

    "Title": "4 Ways to Avoid Sickness from Swimming",
    "Content": "On a hot summer day, nothing cools you off faster than a dip in the pool. But, unfortunately, you may be sharing the water with some unwanted germs and parasites. According to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6825a3.htm\">a report recently released</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the number of outbreaks relating to a parasite called cryptosporidium has increased by about 13% per year. The outbreaks, which lead to symptoms of diarrhea, are often associated with pools and water playgrounds.\n\nThe outbreaks sound awful, but there’s no need to throw in the (beach) towel on public pools. Whether you’re getting in a water workout or heading to the waterpark with family, here are four ways you can stay safe while splashing.\n<h4>1. Make sure the pool is safe.</h4>\nProMedica Physician <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/ryan-m-szepiela-md-physical-medicine-and-rehabilitation\">Ryan Szepiela, MD,</a> recommends, “Make sure the pool you are going to is safe and that they are appropriately testing the water.” The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/pdf/swimming/resources/share-fun-not-germs-508c.pdf\">CDC recommends</a> asking to see inspection results or using test strips to check the chemical levels of the pool yourself. The CDC also says there should be little or no chemical odor (as this is a sign of lots of germs mixing with chlorine) and you should be able to see the bottom of the pool, even on the deep end.\n<h4>2. Shower before you get in the water.</h4>\nA pre-swim shower can remove sweat, dirt and other things on your body that can distract pool chemicals from doing their real job of killing germs. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/pdf/swimming/resources/share-fun-not-germs-508c.pdf\">CDC</a>, one minute is all it takes to remove the things that use up pool chemicals.\n<h4>3. Don’t swallow the water.</h4>\nThis rule is pretty easy for adults, but may be difficult for young swimmers. “I know it’s hard to control this with younger kids, but warn them before they get in not to be drinking or swallowing the water,” says Dr. Szepiela.\n<h4>4. Stay out of the water if you’ve had diarrhea.</h4>\n“Studies show that some people wait less than a day to get back into the water if they’ve had a diarrhea illness,” says Dr. Szepiela. “Typically, you should wait at least seven days.” Check with your doctor about returning to normal activities just to be safe.",

But she knows that while the prep isn't pleasant, it's definitely necessary.\n\nFor more than 16 years, she's treated patients with colon cancer in the Toledo area. In many cases, if patients had come in sooner, the cancer would have been diagnosed earlier, or, in some cases, they could have prevented the cancer entirely. In fact, up to 90% of colon cancers could be prevented if people were scoped at the appropriate times.\n\nTo erase some of the misconceptions about colonoscopy prep and to help raise awareness about colon cancer screening, Dr. Sipe recorded her experience before, during and after her procedure.

    "Title": "March Madness Leads to Rise in Vasectomies",
    "Content": "March Madness gives basketball lovers a chance to create a personalized bracket with their favorite NCAA teams and watch their results unfold. In recent years, healthcare companies across the country have noticed a surprising related trend: a bump in the number of vasectomies scheduled around March Madness. After all, it's the perfect time to rest and binge watch all the action.\n\nWhile a weekend of basketball may influence a man on <em>when</em> he schedules his vasectomy, it won't help a man decide <em>if </em>he wants one. That's why we asked ProMedica urologist <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/timothy-g-schuster-md-facs-urology\">Timothy Schuster, MD,</a> to answer some common questions about vasectomies to determine if it's the right procedure for you if you're considering one.\n\n<strong>Q: What is a vasectomy?\n</strong><strong>A</strong>: A vasectomy is a way to permanently sterilize a man. It is done by cutting and sealing the tubes (vas deferens) that carry sperm from your testicles to your urethra. This prevents fertilization by blocking sperm from mixing with seminal fluid before it's ejaculated.\n\n<strong>How long does the procedure take?\n</strong>The outpatient procedure can last anywhere from 20 – 30 minutes and can be done under local anesthesia. Men are able to drive themselves home after; however, it may be a little uncomfortable.\n\n<strong>How long is recovery?\n</strong>A couple days of little to no physical activity are necessary. Some men place frozen peas or bags of ice on the area to minimize soreness.\n\n<strong>What are some common misconceptions about vasectomies?\n</strong>One of the most common misconceptions is that the testicles are disrupted; however the sterilization happens because of the interruption of sperm flow. Your body will continue to make sperm after a vasectomy but it will be reabsorbed into your body. Vasectomies do not affect testosterone levels, sex drive or the man’s ability to have an erection. Multiple studies have also shown that there is no connection between a vasectomy and an increased risk of prostate cancer.\n\n<strong>How soon can I have sex after a vasectomy?\n</strong>Most men are able to resume sexual activity one week after their vasectomy. However, you will need to use alternative forms of contraception until we confirm that the vasectomy worked. At our office, we ask men to drop off samples starting two months after the procedure and we continue to check every 3-4 weeks until two samples in a row show no sperm. At that point, we let the man know that they can stop using alternate birth control.\n\n<strong>Do vasectomies ever fail?\n</strong>It is possible, which is why the post-op checks are important. The only way you will know if the procedure failed is by dropping off a specimen or if your partner gets pregnant. Unfortunately, not even half of all men who receive a vasectomy comply with the post-op check, which we counsel our patients to do during the initial visit. We also encourage men to recheck annually, as there are rare reports of late failures, when specimens tested negative for sperm but then tested positive over time.\n\n<strong>What can a man expect at the initial visit?\n</strong>Before the vasectomy, you'll come in for an initial consult with the urologist to discuss the procedure. This will also include a physical exam.\n\n<strong>Are vasectomies reversible?\n</strong>Yes, some vasectomies may be reversed, but the reversal process isn’t always successful and insurance rarely pays for it. Data shows that about 3% of men who get a vasectomy get a reversal. However, you should consider a vasectomy to be permanent.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Have more questions about a vasectomy?</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/medical-services/urology/what-is-a-vasectomy.aspx\"] Read our FAQs [/button]</p>",

    "Content": "Your pelvic floor includes all of the muscles, ligaments, connective tissue and nerves that support the organs in your pelvis. And sometimes, like any muscle in your body, your pelvic muscles need a little exercise.\n\nThat's where <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/sara-anderson-dpt-physical-therapy\">Sara Yunghans, DPT</a>, comes in. As a pelvic floor physical therapist, she specializes in using physical therapy techniques to treat pelvic floor conditions. These conditions include urinary or fecal incontinence, pelvic pain, constipation and sexual dysfunction.\n\n\"The [pelvic floor] muscles work like muscles in our arms and in our shoulders in that they can be strengthened,\" explained Yunghans. \"The more that they're strengthened, the less likely you are to have things like incontinence when you cough, sneeze and laugh. We can train those muscles to do that with Kegels.\"\n\nKegels are just one of the therapies Yunghans uses to help treat pelvic floor disorders. If you're unfamiliar with Kegels, it's an exercise that's done to make the vaginal muscles contract, or squeeze. They're a good way to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, but they aren't recommended for everyone.\n\n\"Women who have a history of pelvic pain, abdominal pain, previous surgeries or pain or discomfort with sex should be checked out by a provider so we can establish whether Kegels are appropriate,\" said Yunghans.\n\nIf it's safe for you to do Kegels, it's an exercise you can do virtually anywhere at any time.\n\n\"It's always helpful if you can align them with something you're doing normally throughout your day,\" suggested Yunghans. \"Right before or after breakfast lunch and dinner is a good time.\"\n<h4>How to Kegel</h4>\nWatch the video below to see Anderson explain how to properly do Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ogif0pVX87E\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Curious about pelvic floor physical therapy?</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/womens-services/Pages/gynecology/pelvic-health/pelvic-floor-physical-therapy.aspx\"] Learn more [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "When Parents Overstep Boundaries On Social Media",
    "Content": "In 2006, Facebook changed its policy from allowing only college students to sign up for accounts to allowing access to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address. Fast forward to 2015 and now moms, dads and even grandparents have joined in on the social media frenzy. In fact, usage among seniors continues to increase.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/01/09/demographics-of-key-social-networking-platforms-2/\">Pew Research Center</a>, 45% of Facebook users say they are Facebook friends with their parents and 43% say they are friends with their children. The online interaction between parents and their children, as well as their friends' children and their children's friends, can get complicated.\n\nLuke Johnson, QHHS-CPST, Case Manager of Youth &amp; Family Services at <a href=\"http://www.harbor.org/\">Harbor Behavioral Health</a>, an affiliate of ProMedica, says issues with social media within parents, children and families have to do with boundaries and what they look like. “Just because it is so easy to communicate with whoever you want, wherever you want, does not mean we should necessarily do it.”\n\nIn other words, you may want to think twice before exposing your child's embarrassing \"throwback\" pictures or before making mushy or sensitive comments public.\n\n<strong>Friending a Friend of a Child</strong>\n\nRespecting boundaries extends beyond the family, too.\n\nBefore friending your child's friends, Johnson recommends speaking with the child’s parents beforehand, specifically if they are still a minor. “There are still legal issues that could come up even unintentionally. It’s also a respect issue,” he says.\n\nBefore you send them a message, Johnson advises, “Relate it back to before there was social media. Could you see yourself calling your child’s friend on the phone? If you wouldn’t do that, maybe it’s not a good idea to message them in a different way. If you wouldn’t have called, should you be messaging them? It’s a safe guard. Ask yourself, ‘What is the purpose of this?’ ‘Why am I doing that?’”\n\nHe continues, “Facebook gives us a perceived fulfillment of connectedness of others. It’s desirable to feel connected but we overlook seeing consequences if we don’t think about it a little more.”\n\n<strong>Parents Can Cyberbully, Too </strong>\n\nCyber bullying is another issue that Johnson sees frequently with parents. “People are constantly trying to portray themselves in a perfect way and they develop self-worth based on social media currency,” he says. “An unhealthy way to boost self-esteem is to put others down during the same process. Parents try to one-up other parents or children by making certain comments on pictures or statuses, or by bringing their child into the mix to increase social media currency.”\n\nJohnson states that social media allows for situations that wouldn’t normally get brought up in the real world to appear in the social world, making people feel less included or less worthy.\n\n“This is breeding ground for issues of self-worth and feeling of belonging,” Johnson says. “Before Facebook, people wouldn’t know what party they were feeling left out of. It adds fuel to fire by putting things out for not only the child or parent to see, but also onlookers.”\n\nWhile social media attracts people of all ages, Johnson believes that too often, parents are more consumed by it than their own children.\n\n“Parents are paying more attention to it than their kids, sharing pictures and saying ‘I am so proud of them’ and thinking ‘I want to show everyone. Look, your picture got 50 likes!’ When in reality, the child just wants a hug and to hear their parent say they are proud and that they love them,” says Johnson. “Sometimes people get so wrapped up in social media and parents are so preoccupied showing the world how much they love their child that they forget to actually show them.”\n\n<strong>Think Before You Post</strong>\n\nJohnson offers the following basic guidelines for parents using social media:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Communicate with other parents</li>\n \t<li>Be mindful and cautious</li>\n \t<li>Use moderation</li>\n \t<li>Have forethought with how you’re interacting with your children and their friends</li>\n</ul>\n“Things are at the end of our fingertips and it’s easy to friend request someone; we do it almost instinctively,” says Johnson. “Always think about what your purpose is and why you’re doing it and try to consider outcomes of how it could be good or misconstrued. Just remember, thousands of people can see this activity, which can lead to thousands of different perceptions.”\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-3630 \" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/iStock_000050633752_Large-e1430744125321-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"Friends sending text messages\" width=\"89\" height=\"89\" /> <em><a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/general-health/does-social-media-cause-teen-anxiety/\">Does social media cause anxiety in teens?

    "Title": "The Truth About Vaccines",
    "Content": "There has been a lot of debate around childhood vaccines over the past few years. However, vaccines play a pivotal role in the health of children and our communities. It is estimated that over the past two decades, vaccines have prevented 322 million illnesses, 21 million hospitalizations, and 732,000 deaths in the United States alone.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jacob-maciejewski-md-pediatrics\">Jacob Maciejewski, MD, a pediatrician with ProMedica Physicians</a>, explains that vaccines are extremely important in preventing the spread of dangerous, contagious diseases.\n\n“By vaccinating our children, we protect them from potentially life-threatening illnesses, and also protect those around us who are unable to be vaccinated, such as those undergoing chemotherapy or others with a weakened immune system,” says Dr. Maciejewski.\n\n<strong>How Vaccines Work</strong>\n\nVaccines teach our bodies what it takes to fight off a foreign invader.\n\n“Vaccines contain antigens which are essentially proteins and sugar molecules found on the surface of a virus or bacteria,” explains Dr. Maciejewski. “These antigens are injected into the body allowing the immune system to recognize them as foreign. The immune system is then able to build a memory and form antibodies so that when it is challenged with the real thing, the virus or bacteria is destroyed before it has the chance to cause infection.”\n\n<strong>Common Vaccine Myths</strong>\n\nThere are several myths surrounding vaccines, one of the most common being that they can cause autism spectrum disorders. However, scientific research has repeatedly disproved this myth. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have conducted or sponsored more than <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/pdf/cdcstudiesonvaccinesandautism.pdf\">10 different studies</a> in the past 13 years to examine the relationship between vaccines and autism. These studies, which examined more than a million children, were unable to find any links between the two. Health organizations such as the Institute of Medicine (IOM), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), World Health Organization (WHO) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) have conducted similar reviews and studies and strongly support the safety of immunizations.\n\nAnother popular myth is that children receive too many vaccines at a single visit which can overwhelm their immune system. Dr. Maciejewski explains that this is also false. Before vaccines are administered to children, they are studied to see how they react when given together to make sure they don’t interfere with one another or the rest of the body.\n\nStudies have also addressed the question on whether too many vaccines at once can cause developmental delays in children. A 2010 study in the <em>Journal of Pediatrics</em> compared children who received vaccines on time versus children who received a delayed vaccination schedule or no vaccines at all in the first year of life. It was found both groups performed similarly on developmental testing at the age of 7-10 years and there was no increased risk for ADHD.\n\n<strong>When to Vaccinate Your Child</strong>\n\nThe CDC recommends the following vaccine schedule for children from birth through 18 years old. <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Childhood-Vaccine-Schedule2.pdf\">Click here to download a printable chart.</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Childhood-Vaccine-Schedule.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-4354 \" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Childhood-Vaccine-Schedule.jpg\" alt=\"Childhood Vaccine Schedule\" width=\"550\" height=\"424\" /></a>\n\nIf you have questions or concerns about your child’s vaccines, you should first talk to your doctor. They will have the best understanding of your child’s health and risks for certain diseases.",

    "Title": "5 Ways to Connect With Cancer Patients",
    "Content": "When cancer enters the life of someone you care about, it’s natural to want to offer encouragement and assistance. While experts agree that a strong support system is critical to a cancer patient’s journey, they also understand that it may be difficult to know exactly what to say or do. Here are five ways to help a loved one who is living with cancer.\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Acknowledge what’s happening.</strong> Sometimes when you discover that a friend or family member has been diagnosed with cancer, you may feel uncomfortable about addressing the situation for fear of upsetting him or her. But ignoring things may make your loved one feel even more upset and isolated. Instead, simply say: “I hear you’ve had some bad news. I’m sorry.”</li>\n\t<li><strong>Lend a hand.</strong> Fighting cancer can be exhausting. Doctors’ visits and treatments are added on top of the individual’s routine responsibilities. Offer to help by driving the patient to an appointment, doing a load of laundry or making dinner. Whatever you do, don’t wait to be asked, and make sure to follow through.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Privacy, please.</strong> Cancer patients sometimes feel that their lives have suddenly become open books. Help your friend or family member reclaim his or her privacy by not talking about their condition or treatment with others. Make sure to get permission before you share information. When in doubt, be discreet.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Choose your words wisely.</strong> Words have the power to heal, but some words can hurt. Even the most well-meaning people can make statements that may be misunderstood. In particular, it’s important not to speculate about how or why your friend got cancer. Instead, be sensitive and take cues from your loved one regarding his or her feelings.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Listen.</strong> The single most important thing you can do is listen. Be open and receptive to your loved one’s need to talk about what he or she is experiencing, feeling or thinking – no matter how big or small the topic of conversation.</li>\n</ol>\n&nbsp;",
