    "Title": "Dieting: The Good, the Fad and the Ugly",
    "Content": "New diets that promise quick weight loss are constantly making an appearance in social media feeds. While they may seem new and innovative, some version of most of these diets have been around for years and are commonly known as “fad diets.”\n\n“For example, the Atkins diet was all the rage in the 1960s, but eventually lost popularity. It was quickly replaced with another low-carb version, the Keto diet, in the early 2000s,” shares Deborah Karl, MS, RD, LD, CDCES, registered dietitian and certified diabetes care and education specialist with ProMedica.\n\nWhile tempting, trying a fad diet is typically not the best plan for your overall and long-term health. Diets with the following traits should always be avoided:\n<ul>\n \t<li>It promises rapid weight loss.</li>\n \t<li>It claims to have a secret strategy or markets specific “super foods” or products with it.</li>\n \t<li>It’s very low calorie or severely restricts or forbids certain foods or food groups, especially fruit, whole grains or fats. Ask yourself, “Can I eat this way the rest of my life?” If the answer is no, the plan is not for you.</li>\n \t<li>There is poor, biased or no scientific research to support the claims.</li>\n \t<li>The plan or product is temporary with no nutrition education or transition phase involved.</li>\n \t<li>The plan suggests that food or supplements can alter your body chemistry or pH.</li>\n \t<li>If the claims sound too good to be true, they probably are.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Why You Should Avoid Fad Diets</h2>\nSimply put, you should avoid fad diets because they don’t work. They often encourage severe restriction, either of food entirely or of specific foods or food groups. This leads to increased cravings, binge eating and as a result, weight regain. In fact, it’s estimated that more than 80 percent of people regain weight after a temporary diet plan.\n\n“Fad diets can also negatively impact our mental health,” Karl shares. “Not being able to sustain a rigid eating pattern can lead to feelings of failure and depression, and binge eating can leave us feeling guilty and anxious about food.”\n<h2>How To Lose Weight and Not Gain It Back</h2>\nRather than focusing on the newest weight loss trend, focus on improving your overall eating and exercise habits. Instead of cutting out all unhealthy habits for a certain amount of time, reduce your unhealthy habits slowly over time. For example, instead of getting fast food every day, try every other day for a couple of months, then twice a week, once a week and so on.\n\nAs you are reducing your unhealthy habits, begin increasing your healthy ones. Maybe you start with increasing your steps each day. Or making the goal to eat at least one serving of fruits and vegetables every day.\n<h2>Healthy Weight Loss</h2>\nA healthy amount of weight loss is between a half pound to two pounds per week. “If you lose weight too quickly, you will lose muscle, bone, and water and you are more likely to regain that weight,” Karl shares. Be sure to not solely rely on the scale for your only measure of success. Focus on the healthy habits that you have established, healthier food selections you are making, and how much better you feel.\n\nYou don’t have to make big changes to have big success. It’s the small changes over time that will yield greater results in the long run.",

    "Title": "The Effects of Caffeine on Your Body",
    "Content": "Caffeine is a close friend of many — whether you prefer your daily dose through coffee, tea or soda.  But did you ever wonder what’s going on inside your body when you gurgle down your favorite caffeinated beverage? Here’s a look at what caffeine does to your brain and organs, and when to avoid it.\n<h2>Your Brain on Caffeine</h2>\nYour brain is made up of all kinds of tissues, cells and hormones working together to tell your body what to do. One of the most important players is the neurotransmitter, which are chemicals that relay information between nerve signals to regulate body processes.\n\nWhen caffeine makes its way up to our brains, it forms a strange relationship with the chemical processes already taking place, especially the process that regulates sleepiness. Adenosine is one such chemical that when accumulated, will tell your body it’s time to rest. Adenosine is received by adenosine receptors in the brain, and since caffeine looks deceivingly like adenosine, it can easily sneak in and block the receptors. Without adenosine, other neurotransmitters can’t get to work.\n\nCaffeine is a central nervous system stimulant that causes us to be more alert and awake, while increasing concentration. When caffeine finally wears off, it allows the adenosine — that’s been accumulating all this time — to come rushing back in. This is why we feel our bodies crash after a jolt of caffeine.\n\n“Some research has suggested that the timing of caffeine can have a variable effect on the crash experienced,” shares <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-rennels-do-family-medicine\">Matthew Rennels, DO</a>, a provider with ProMedica Family Medicine. “Because adenosine builds up throughout the day, delaying consumption of caffeine until late morning or early afternoon may help lessen the symptoms of the caffeine crash. This is due to your body having extra time to begin processing some of the adenosine before being exposed to caffeine.”\n<h2>Caffeine and Your Other Organs</h2>\nWhile your brain is adjusting to caffeine’s effects, your cardiovascular system is working overtime. Your heart begins pumping harder and faster and can even raise your blood pressure by about 10mmHg.\n\nDown in your gastrointestinal system, caffeine can raise the amount of acid produced by the stomach, causing reflux. It can also increase cholecystokinin which is a hormone that can increase gallbladder contraction. If you have gallbladder issues such as gallstones or gallbladder disease, this can worsen symptoms.\n\nAnother organ working hard is your kidneys, which help your body by filtering out all the substances it can’t use. And while some studies suggest coffee isn’t as dehydrating as once thought, in large amounts, caffeine speeds up this filtration process while inhibiting your body from reabsorbing sodium. All that sodium has to go somewhere, and while it’s exiting your body, it’s pulling water with it. This particular side effect is why you find yourself running to the bathroom more frequently.\n<h2>When To Avoid Caffeine</h2>\nWomen don’t often think about caffeine impacting their reproductive health, but it’s one more area to consider. Expectant moms may choose to avoid caffeine because it has the capability to pass through the placenta and cause fetal symptoms similar to those caused in adults if consumed in large amounts.\n\nWhen caffeine cruises through our bloodstream, it can touch virtually every organ in our bodies. Since we’re now aware of how the substance affects some of our major organs, someone with a chronic condition associated with one or more of these body systems could potentially see adverse effects.\n\nThose who experience acid reflux, uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias or other heart conditions should avoid caffeine entirely or consume it carefully in moderation. For some, caffeine consumption may also precipitate headaches, migraines, insomnia and anxiety.\n\n“There are multiple forms of caffeine and each can have a highly variable effect on your body as it relates to the dose and delivery,” Dr. Rennels explains. Consider the milligrams of caffeine that you are consuming – whether it be through coffee, tea, food or pill.\n<h2>Benefits of Caffeine</h2>\nThe news about caffeine’s impact on organs and body systems isn’t all bad. Research suggests that caffeine may be attributed to a decreased risk of developing conditions such as type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, liver disease, heart disease and depression. Additionally, caffeine consumption is linked to increased cognitive function, alertness and even athletic performance.\n\nWhen consumed in reasonable amounts, caffeine can be a helpful tool to get you up and moving.\n\n“Treat caffeine like any other supplement,” Dr. Rennels explains. “Use it in moderation and discuss your use of it with your primary care provider.” They will be able to provide any recommendations on your caffeine consumption based on your personal health.",

    "Title": "How To Eat Healthier While Working From Home",
    "Content": "It can be a struggle to live, work and eat within the same four walls. Susan George, MS, RD, LD, dietitian and clinical nutrition manager with ProMedica, offers five tips to help you eat and live healthier while working from home.\n<h2>1. Have a dedicated workspace.</h2>\nDedicate a space as your work-from-home space, whether it’s an office, a closet nook or a sunroom. Avoid making your dedicated space in the kitchen – having cabinets full of snacks in view all day can be tempting, even to those with the strongest wills.\n\nThen, make your work-from-home space a food-free zone. This will help you avoid mindless snacking while staring at the computer screen and help promote some much-needed breaks throughout your day.\n<h2>2. Plan and prep your meals and snacks.</h2>\nJust like you would do if you were going into the office, plan what you’re going to eat for the day and when, and then prep it ahead of time. If you plan to have a salad for lunch, chop up the lettuce and toppings the night before or in the morning before your workday starts. If you plan to eat leftovers from the night before, plate them up so you can just throw it in the microwave when lunchtime comes.\n\n“Create a schedule of when you plan to eat breakfast, lunch and snacks,” Ms. George shares. “This will help you avoid mindless snacking and overeating during your workday.”\n<h2>3. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!</h2>\n[row]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nAim to drink six to eight glasses of water every day. “Always have a glass or bottle of water available at your workstation,” Ms. George shares. Try to drink a glass of water before grabbing a snack if you get hungry throughout the day.\n\nAdditionally, avoid or limit caffeine. You shouldn’t exceed more than two cups of coffee a day. If you are needing a warm drink, green tea is a great option as it has less caffeine than coffee and promotes good digestive health.\n<h2>4. Fill your grocery list and your plate with the right foods.</h2>\nFuel your body with the right food and nutrients to perform to the best of your abilities in both your work and personal life. Limit the number of processed or junk foods on your grocery list. Meals should include a lean protein such as chicken, fish, lentils or tofu, fruits and/or vegetables and a whole grain such as brown rice or quinoa.\n\n“Fill your grocery list with seasonally fresh produce. If you can, go plant-based for a couple of meals a week. Studies continue to show the benefits of a plant-based diet which can be nutrient dense, packed with fiber, protein, healthy fats, vitamins and minerals,” shares Ms. George. “Instead of processed snacks, try fresh snacks like apples and low-fat peanut butter, plain Greek yogurt and fresh berries, or baby carrots and hummus.”\n<h2>5. Take breaks.</h2>\nGet up and walk around the house, stand during a meeting, go sit in the sun, do a few stretches or pet your dog.\n\n“Working from home offers unique benefits that you may not have when working in the office,” Ms. George shares. “You may not want to get up and stretch in the middle of a crowded office, but nothing is stopping you from getting up and moving your body for a few minutes when working from home!”\n\nFood can positively or negatively impact your workday. Focus on consistently eating a balanced diet to become a healthier, happier and more productive you.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/How-To-Eat-Healthier-Working-from-Home.pdf\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-8920 size-large\" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/How-To-Eat-Healthier-Working-from-Home-1-410x1024.png\" alt=\"Infographic illustrating the five ways to eat healthier while working from home. \" width=\"410\" height=\"1024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]",

    "Title": "Get Started With Weight Training",
    "Content": "Lifting weights isn’t just for bodybuilders, athletes or weekend warriors. A regular weight training routine can be very beneficial for strengthening bones and muscles.\n\nMary Arend, a personal trainer and Pilates instructor at ProMedica ForeverFit, says that weight training can help those who are hoping to decrease body fat, improve athletic performance and become physically stronger. A regular strength program can reduce risk of injury, back pain, arthritis, heart disease and diabetes. It may also help improve attitude and fight depression. One of the greatest benefits of weight training is that it can also help decrease the risk of osteoporosis.\n\n“Weight bearing exercise and resistance training are crucial for preventing osteoporosis-related fractures and other injuries,” Arend says. “Not only can weight training improve bone density, it can also improve muscle mass, balance and connective tissue strength — all which decrease the risk of falling and breaking something.”\n\nWhen you lift weights, it’s the larger bones that benefit the most. Arend shares that the spine, femur, hips and frame of the body are primarily affected. “Weight training typically affects the bones that take the most abuse.”\n<h2><span class=\"Heading2Char\">Starting Your Weight Training Routine</span></h2>\nIf you’ve been inactive for some time, or have never engaged in weight training exercises, Arend recommends starting small to prevent injury, and following these steps:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Begin with dumbbells or resistance bands that weigh one to five pounds.</li>\n \t<li>Engage in 30 minutes of resistance-training activity each day. Try a mix of weight training and higher-impact activities, such as jogging, arc trainer, elliptical and step aerobics.</li>\n \t<li>As you grow stronger, increase the amount of weight you lift to maximize bone-building benefits.</li>\n</ol>\nArend shares a few pointers for safe weightlifting:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Talk with your primary care provider first.</strong> They can make help you create a plan that works with your capabilities and goals.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Warm up properly to avoid injuries.</strong> Working out cold muscles can lead to sprains and tears.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use correct form when lifting.</strong> Stand straight, head over shoulders, over hips, over feet.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Keep your abdominal muscles tight while weight training.</strong> Contract your abs as though you are being punched in the stomach, but don’t hold your breath. This will stabilize your pelvis and keep your knees over toes.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Don’t do too much too soon.</strong> Learn the moves with bodyweight first. When you can do 15 reps with proper form, add weights.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Work opposing muscles. </strong>For every front exercise, perform one for the back of the body. Balance is key.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Consider Pilates to build stabilizers. </strong>Stabilizers are important muscles for the body and help support the bigger muscles, providing you a safer workout.</li>\n</ul>",

    "Title": "Eating the Right Foods Can Help Fuel Your Workouts",
    "Content": "A good eating routine is necessary to reach your goals in the gym and to stay healthy. A balanced and healthy diet gives you energy that can help maximize your workout. So does staying hydrated.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/ryan-m-szepiela-md-physical-medicine-and-rehabilitation\">Ryan Szepiela, MD, </a>ProMedica Physicians Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, explains that what you eat before and after your workout can be just as important as the workout itself.\n<h2>Why is it important to eat before your workout?</h2>\nFood is your fuel and so you definitely do not want to exercise on an empty stomach. Regardless of whether your goal is to build muscle or lose weight, your diet is central to this process. A healthy diet should include good lean protein and consuming a small to moderate amount of carbohydrates. I also recommend drinking at least a gallon of water per day.\n\nYou should always assess how much time you have to eat beforehand. If you are not pressed for time, I recommend having a sandwich or vegetables anywhere from two or three hours before your workout. A turkey sandwich or roasted vegetables are excellent choices.\n\nIf you exercise after work, I recommend a light snack at least 20 to 30 minutes ahead of time. A protein bar, yogurt, wholegrain toast, fresh or dried fruit are great sources of carbohydrates.\n<h2>What should you avoid before working out?</h2>\nIt is important to be selective about what you eat before working out. You should avoid foods that are high in fat or fiber. It is not a good idea to eat a full meal before working out. This can drain your energy and may upset your stomach. It is ideal to have a light and healthy snack in advance. What is most important is to try different foods to determine what works best for you. What works for someone else may not be right for you.\n<h2>Why is it important to stay well hydrated?</h2>\nProper hydration starts before your workout. It can give you more energy and ensure that your body doesn’t get dehydrated. I recommend drinking 10 ounces for every 20 minutes of planned exercise prior to exercising. If you will be outdoors or in a warm environment, such as hot yoga, you need to drink more fluids prior to the activity and it is a good idea to also have a bottle of water nearby as you start to feel thirsty. Water is the best choice. Save the sports drinks for extended training like marathon training or extended lifting.\n<h2>What should I eat after my workout?</h2>\nTo reap the benefits of your workout, you need to replenish nutrients as soon as possible. This is important to help replace the energy that you lost and help your body recover faster. I recommend increasing your protein intake if you are trying to build new muscle or repair damaged muscle. Consuming carbohydrates is the best way to restore energy. Try having peanut butter and toast, yogurt and granola, fruit or even a glass of milk within 20 to 30 minutes after working out. This should be followed by a full meal a couple of hours later.\n<h2>Why is it important to talk to your doctor about your workout routine?</h2>\nIt is always a good idea to talk to your family physician for guidance, especially before starting a new fitness routine. They can make recommendations to help ensure that you have a productive and safe workout based on your current health condition, any medications that you’re taking and personal health history. It is also important to pay attention to how you feel during your workout and to discuss it with your physician. Perhaps you are overdoing it or just need to try something different. I recommend working with your doctor to set reasonable goals. Remember everyone is different and you need to find the best workout routine for you.",

    "Content": "Your future health is impacted by the actions you take today. Rick Black, PT, DPT, MS, corporate rehabilitation director, ProMedica, shares four ways that you can set yourself up for a healthier future:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>If you smoke, quit smoking.</strong> “If you’ve tried before and been unsuccessful, try again,” encourages Black. “Quitting smoking can have an incredibly positive impact on your life. Work with your health care provider to find a smoking cessation program that works for you.”</li>\n \t<li><strong>Drink alcohol in moderation.</strong> Alcohol contains an excess number of calories that can have a major impact on your weight and overall health. Consider how many calories you are drinking, and try to cut back where you can.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat a healthy, balanced diet.</strong> Consume a variety of fruits, vegetables and lean proteins, and pay attention to your portion sizes. Avoid or limit foods and beverages that don’t provide nutrients to your body such as soda and sweets.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Increase your physical activity.</strong> Seek out opportunities to move more. “If you have the opportunity to take a flight of stairs rather than taking an elevator, take the flight of stairs,” Black shares. Start small and build from there.</li>\n</ul>\nOnce you get started, it can sometimes be hard to keep going. Black recommends utilizing a buddy system to help keep yourself accountable. Find someone you can share your goals with and work together to improve your health and well-being.\n\nKeeping track of where you started and the progress you are making can also be beneficial. Black recommends keeping a journal of the actions you are taking on your health and well-being journey. This will help you see the progress you are making and give yourself the credit you deserve!\n\nLearn more about what you can do now to set yourself up for a healthy future <a href=\"https://promedica.org/after40podcast?segitem=48492\">in this episode </a>of <em>Happily Ever After 40</em>.  The podcast, brought to you by ProMedica, explores the joys and challenges that many experience during midlife.

    "Title": "Should you be taking supplements?",
    "Content": "Nowadays, everyone seems to be taking some type of supplement for some reason or another - but do you actually need them? Before adding any type of dietary supplement to your routine, it’s important to understand the risks and benefits. Chloe Plummer, MS, RD, LD, clinical dietitian at ProMedica, shares about supplements and how to know if you should be taking them.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines dietary supplements as products taken by mouth that include a “dietary ingredient.” This could be anything from vitamins, to minerals, herbs, amino acids or other substances that are meant to supplement what you eat.\n\nIt’s important to note that the best way to get all the nutrients that our bodies need is through food. Most people who consume a balanced diet with a variety of foods from each food group don’t need to take supplements.\n<h2>Who may need a supplement?</h2>\nIndividuals who have increased nutrient needs or difficulty meeting nutrient needs may benefit from taking supplements. This may include people who have a nutrient deficiency that cannot be met by food alone, pregnant women, older adults or individuals who avoid major groups of food due to an allergy, intolerance or dietary preference.\n\nFor example, pregnant women are often advised to take a prenatal vitamin to help meet their increased needs for nutrients such as iron and folic acid during pregnancy. Individuals who follow a vegan diet may need a vitamin B12 supplement since the major sources of B12 in the diet are animal products.\n<h2>How To Take Supplements Safely</h2>\nEven though supplements are regulated by the FDA, they are regulated differently than food and prescription medications. In most cases, the FDA is only able to review the safety of dietary supplements once they are already on the market. Some supplements have been found to include a different amount of the dietary ingredient than is listed on the label, and some may even contain contaminants.\n\nFollow these guidelines to make sure that you are choosing a quality supplement:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Look for supplements that have been evaluated and reviewed by a separate organization</strong> such as U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP), ConsumerLab, or NSF International. The supplement will have the organization’s seal on the label, which means the product has been tested and meets manufacturing standards, contains the ingredients on the label and does not include contaminants that may be harmful.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Take supplements in recommended doses</strong>. Too much of certain vitamins and minerals can be harmful. Many vitamins and minerals have a Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), which is the highest dose you should safely take to avoid side effects or harm.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Check the Daily Value (DV).</strong> The DV that you see on a supplement or food label usually lists the amount recommended per day for an average adult, but may also state the DV for infants, children or pregnant and lactating women. The DV may not be the amount that you specifically need, based on your age and sex. For more individualized recommendations, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nal.usda.gov/human-nutrition-and-food-safety/dri-calculator\">USDA’s website </a>and talk with your doctor or dietitian. With supplements, try to avoid high doses of any one nutrient or doses that are well above 100% of the DV, unless this has been recommended by your doctor or dietitian. Remember, more is not always better when it comes to supplements.</li>\n</ol>\nSupplements should not take the place of a healthy diet, but they can sometimes help your body get the nutrients that it needs. If you are thinking about starting a supplement, make sure that you have a reason to do so and that there is research to support the supplement’s claims. Talk to your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/primary-care\">primary care provider</a> or <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/nutrition-counseling\">dietitian</a> to determine if taking a supplement would be beneficial to you.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    "Title": "Probiotics vs. Prebiotics: What’s the difference?",
    "Content": "Bacteria is a normal part of our bodies that plays an important role in our health. Your gut has “good bacteria” called microflora that may help improve digestive health, aid in immune system function, and possibly even improve mental health. Sometimes, this bacteria is diminished due to antibiotic use, poor diet, inactivity or disease.\n\nProbiotics and prebiotics are foods or supplements may help restore or maintain this bacteria in the gut. But how do they work?\n<h2>Probiotics vs. Prebiotics</h2>\n“It is estimated that there are about as many bacteria in the body as the number of human cells, and possibly even more,” says Chloe Plummer, MS, RD, LD, a registered dietitian with the ProMedica Food Clinic. Probiotics contain this “good bacteria,” while prebiotics feed and support the development of probiotics in the body.\n\nProbiotics are foods or supplements that contain live microorganisms. These microorganisms are thought to maintain or improve the normal microflora (good bacteria) in our gut. Probiotics are naturally found in yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, miso, pickles and other fermented foods.\n\nPrebiotics are foods or supplements that serve as food to probiotics. They are thought to support and increase the number of healthy bacteria in the gut. Prebiotics are naturally found in high-fiber foods such as whole grains, greens, onions, garlic, soybeans, artichokes and bananas.\n\n“I recommend you try eating meals that include both probiotics and prebiotics, such as a yogurt parfait with banana or apple,” shares Plummer.\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\nThe health benefits of specific types of probiotics and prebiotics are not fully understood, and research is ongoing.\n\n“Probiotic foods are not new, but we are just starting to understand the many health benefits,” Plummer shares. “There are many different types of probiotics, and the exact type and amount of bacteria that are most helpful for different health benefits is still being researched.”\n\nWe do know that the best way to get probiotics and prebiotics is through foods in which they are naturally occurring. If you are concerned about consuming enough probiotics and prebiotics, consume foods that contain them before turning to a supplement. Talk to your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">primary care provider</a> to make sure that you are consuming the right amount of nutrients for your body and to determine if a supplement might be right for you.",

    "Title": "3 Things Affecting Your Metabolism (and How To Speed It Up)",
    "Content": "Don’t be too quick to blame weight gain or obesity on a slow metabolism. Brittany Wynn, MFN, RD, LD, a registered dietitian with ProMedica Weight Loss Surgery, explains that the key to increasing your metabolism is in your hands!\n<h2>What is metabolism?</h2>\nSimply put, metabolism is the amount of energy your body expends each day. It is the amount of energy your body needs daily for normal body functioning, digestion, daily activities and exercise.\n<h2>What affects your metabolism?</h2>\nThree factors affect your metabolism and contribute to how fast, or slow, your metabolism is.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Body composition:</strong> If you have more lean muscle mass, you will burn more calories during the day because it requires more energy.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Gender:</strong> Men typically have more lean muscle mass and less fat mass than women do, so they have higher energy requirements and need more calories as a result.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Activity level:</strong> The more physically active that you are throughout the day, the more energy your body needs and the higher your total energy expenditure (metabolism) will be.</li>\n</ol>\n“A big fallacy is that our metabolism slows down as we age,” Wynn shares. “Usually it is us that slows down.” As we get older, our lifestyles change and often become busier. Many people have sedentary desk jobs and don’t have as much time to exercise or cook at home. As a result of our lifestyle change, our metabolism slows because our body does not need as many calories as we are consuming.\n<h2>Changing Your Metabolism</h2>\nIf you’ve started to gain weight and feel that your metabolism is slower, there is good news – it is not something out of our control. You can change your metabolism by making lifestyle changes that increase your daily energy need, therefore increasing your metabolism.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Diet:</strong>Aim to eat smaller, balanced meals or snacks every 3 to 4 hours. “Eating smaller, consistent meals makes it easier for the body to get the energy that it needs and stay within your body’s calorie/energy needs,” Wynn recommends.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Exercise:</strong> Adults should aim to get at least 150 minutes of exercise per week. Add in strength training at least two days a week to build muscle mass. “Not only will you burn more calories during strength training, but the increased muscle mass will increase the amount of energy your body burns each day, increasing your metabolism,” Wynn explains.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Adults need 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. “People who sleep less than 7 hours a day tend to eat an average of 200-300 more calories per day than those who get the recommended amount of sleep,” Wynn shares.</li>\n</ul>\nDon’t expect drastic changes after only a couple of weeks of making changes. Make the changes part of your lifestyle, and over time, you will notice a change in your metabolism.",

The air gets crisper.  The temperature drops so we turn our attention toward warmer, perhaps heartier foods. We start to think about the upcoming holidays and all of the food choices we make at this time of the year with all of the “special celebrations.”\n\nThere are so many “fall foods” that are fun to think about – pumpkin flavored EVERYTHING, apple crisp, fresh apples from the orchard, roasted Brussels sprouts, butternut squash soup… the list goes on and on!  As a matter of fact, there are SO MANY fall foods we can’t talk about all of them here but we can focus on one very popular one – the magical pumpkin!\n<h2>Types of Pumpkins</h2>\nPumpkins come in many varieties. The large ones are mostly for decoration or carving because they have a stringier texture that does not provide us with that amazing mouth feel we get from pumpkin pie or pumpkin soup. Pie pumpkins are smaller and sweeter and lend themselves well to almost any pumpkin recipe you want to make. Miniature ones are also typically used for decoration because there is not a lot of “meat” to them once you roast them.\n<h2>Fresh or canned?</h2>\nSo, your next question is probably why would I go through the trouble of roasting a fresh pumpkin when I can buy it canned?  Either will work but I find a taste difference when using fresh, roasted pumpkin in recipes. It’s certainly up to you which you use and as long as it’s 100% canned pumpkin there’s still a lot of nutrition bang for your buck. I would encourage you to be aware that canned “pumpkin pie” pumpkin has sugar added to it, so depending on the recipe you are using it for that may or may not be what you are looking for.\n<h2>Nutrition Information</h2>\nPumpkin is a nutrient dense food with a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories (before we mix in the pie ingredients😊). One cup of pumpkin provides 137 calories, 3 grams of protein, 7 grams of fat, 19 grams of carbohydrate and 7 grams of fiber, along with a significant dose of vitamin A, vitamin K, copper, vitamin E and iron. These nutrients are good for increasing immunity and immune health, eye health, skin health and heart health, as well as improving blood sugars.\n<h2>Pumpkin Recipes</h2>\nLearn how to roast a pumpkin with <a href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-roast-a-pumpkin-224473\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">this blog from kitchn</a> (it’s much easier than you think!) and one of my favorite ways to enjoy pumpkin, in this <a href=\"https://familystylefood.com/turkey-pumpkin-chili/#wprm-recipe-container-15270\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">turkey pumpkin chili</a> recipe from Family Style Food.

    "Title": "Low Glycemic Foods Could Help Boost Your Mood",
    "Content": "We’ve all heard of comfort foods, but have you heard of happy foods? Comfort foods are associated with a sense of nostalgia or hold sentimental value, are often high in calories, fat or sugar, and provide contentment or joy when eaten. Happy foods, on the other hand, might not give you that instant gratification, but they do help stabilize your mood and keep you feeling happy for longer.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-fourman-md-facs-fasmbs-bariatric-surgery\">Matthew Fourman, MD</a>, FACS, FASMBS, a bariatric surgeon with ProMedica Physicians, shares types of foods that can boost your mood and food to stay away from to avoid a slump.\n\n“Focus on foods that have a low glycemic index. These types of foods have a minimal effect on your blood sugar, which will keep you from feeling lethargic after eating and will help stabilize your mood,” Dr. Fourman shares. Examples of low glycemic index foods include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Lean proteins such as chicken, turkey and fish.</li>\n \t<li>Fruits such as apples, strawberries and pears.</li>\n \t<li>Vegetables, especially those that are green and leafy.</li>\n \t<li>Whole grains, nuts and beans.</li>\n</ul>\nOn the other hand, foods with a high glycemic index will cause your blood sugar to spike, negatively impacting your mood once the blood sugar spike drops off. Foods that have a high glycemic index include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Processed foods.</li>\n \t<li>White bread, pasta and potatoes.</li>\n \t<li>Fast food and fried foods.</li>\n \t<li>Foods and drinks high in sugar.</li>\n</ul>\nThese foods often lead to a crash a few hours after consuming them. They also don’t leave you feeling satisfied for nearly as long as foods with a lower glycemic index.\n\n“Think about what happens to your mood when you feel very hungry. You feel irritable, you feel stressed out, and you certainly don’t feel happy. To keep this feeling of agitation away and keep hunger at bay, focus on consuming the foods that keep you satisfied for longer,” Dr. Fourman explains. “Foods that keep you satisfied for longer have a low glycemic index and are high in fiber and lean protein.”\n\nRather than turning to comfort foods in times of stress or unhappiness, focus on fueling your body with foods that will keep you going at your best and improve your mood in the long run. “Food should not be a source of comfort regardless of whether it is ‘healthy’ or not,” shares Dr. Fourman.\n\nIdentifying new outlets to help you release your stress, such as exercise or meditation, will help you move forward instead of keeping you in the same stress cycle.\n\n<em>Dr. Fourman is a board-certified general surgeon who has performed over 2,000 bariatric surgical procedures during the past 10 years of practice. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-fourman-md-facs-fasmbs-bariatric-surgery\">View Dr. Fourman’s profile</a> and learn more about </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/bariatric-surgery/\"><em>bariatric surgery</em></a><em> on ProMedica’s website.</em>",

    "Title": "Don't Have Too Much of a Good Thing | How To Maintain Healthy Cholesterol Levels",
    "Content": "Cholesterol plays a positive and important role in your health, helping your body make new cells and produce vitamins, hormones and bile acids. However, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/high-cholesterol\">high levels of cholesterol</a> in your blood can contribute to clogged arteries and raise your risk for heart disease and stroke. It is important to keep your cholesterol levels in a healthy range to support your heart and overall health and well-being.\n<h2>Understanding Cholesterol</h2>\nYour body makes all the cholesterol it needs. But foods that come from animal sources, such as meats, dairy products and oils that contain saturated fat, also raise cholesterol levels. Additionally, factors such as age, excess weight, family history, lack of exercise and smoking can contribute to unhealthy cholesterol levels.\n\nCholesterol moves through your bloodstream on proteins known as lipoproteins. There are several types:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>High-density lipoprotein (HDL):</strong> Often called “good cholesterol,” HDL helps your body get rid of excess cholesterol, lowering your risk for heart disease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Low-density lipoprotein (LDL):</strong> LDL is the bad cholesterol that causes the most buildup in your arteries. The higher your LDL levels, the greater your risk for cardiovascular disease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL):</strong> VLDL is like LDL, carrying a fat called triglycerides. Alcohol and sugar are two major contributors to high triglyceride levels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Importance of Regular Cholesterol Checks</h2>\nIt is possible to have abnormal cholesterol levels without having any symptoms. This is why regular cholesterol checks are so important. A simple blood test after you fast can provide the information your doctor needs to determine if treatment is needed to ensure your heart health.\n\nThe American Heart Association recommends adults 20 years and older have their cholesterol checked every four to six years if they’re at low risk. Children should be screened once between the age of 9 and 11 and then again between the ages of 17 and 21.\n\nIn general, optimal cholesterol levels for a healthy adult are:\n<ul>\n \t<li>60 mg/dL or higher for HDL.</li>\n \t<li>100 mg/dL or lower for LDL.</li>\n \t<li>200 mg/dL or lower for total cholesterol.</li>\n</ul>\nYour doctor will consider many factors, such as your lifestyle and other health conditions, along with your various cholesterol levels, to weigh your risk for cardiovascular disease and decide if you need treatment.\n<h2>Live a Healthy Lifestyle</h2>\nWhile you can’t control factors like your age or family history, there are many lifestyle changes you can make to maintain healthy cholesterol levels, lower your risk for getting high cholesterol or manage the condition. Exercise regularly, drink alcohol in moderation or not at all, quit smoking and eat a healthy diet with limited saturated fats, trans fats and salt.\n\nIn some cases, your doctor may also recommend medication to help you reach healthier cholesterol levels. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/\">Talk with your doctor</a> if you have concerns about your cholesterol or to learn more ways to lower your risk of heart disease.",

    "Title": "6 Ways Exercise Helps You Breathe Better",
    "Content": "Oxygen is the single most important substance that we take into our body.\n\nOur cells need oxygen to generate energy to transport nutrients, break down toxins, regulate the pH of body chemistry and fight hostile organisms. Getting regular exercise is one of the best ways to improve your flow and support overall health.\n\nExercise has a variety of benefits, but here are the ways in which it can help you breathe better.\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>It improves your access to oxygen. </strong>Improving the oxygen concentration in your environment may help your oxygen intake. If you’re able to exercise outdoors, it can help you increase your access to oxygen. Just be sure to avoid prolonged outside activities on “bad air” days.</li>\n \t<li><strong>It opens up the pulmonary tree. </strong>Deep breathing exercises and aerobic exercise may help improve your lung capacity and help your pulmonary tree function. Another important factor is to avoid smoking. Cigarette smoking can narrow the air passages, make breathing more difficult and raise your risk for lung cancer and other disease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>It helps maintain a healthy fluid balance. </strong>Maintaining an appropriate level of hydration is an important part of good health. It is suggested that the average person loses about 10 cups of water every day, which should be replaced through drink or foods that have high water content. Because thirst is a sign of a fluid deficit, drinking before you are thirsty can help you stay hydrated, especially when you exercise.</li>\n \t<li><strong>It strengthens your heart. </strong>Your body depends on the heart’s pumping action to deliver oxygen- and nutrient-rich blood to the body’s cells. Aerobic exercise, such as walking and cycling, uses oxygen to fuel the muscles and strengthens your heart by teaching it how to take an increasing demand.</li>\n \t<li><strong>It can help lower blood pressure. </strong>High blood pressure is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. You can have high blood pressure (hypertension) for years without any symptoms. Even without symptoms, damage to blood vessels and your heart continues and can be detected. If you have high blood pressure, regular exercise may help you regulate your blood pressure.</li>\n \t<li><strong>It feeds your cells. </strong>Our cells are happier when they are free of infection. Preventing infection and maintaining healthy blood glucose levels are some basic ways to keep the cells happy. Regular exercise can play a part in keeping cells healthy by supporting your immune system and blood sugar levels. This may help your cells function to improve oxygen flow.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Starting Your Exercise Plan</h2>\nWith warmer weather ahead, Rick Black, PT, DPT, MS, corporate rehabilitation director, ProMedica, says that now is a great time to start an exercise program and reap the benefits of better oxygen intake.\n\n“The best exercise is the one you’ll do. Start with something simple like walking and find activities that you enjoy doing,” Mr. Black advises. “If you’re not exercising regularly, make sure to speak with your doctor before starting your exercise program.”\n\nMr. Black also recommends finding a workout partner and writing down your exercise goals and activity. Tracking your movement will help you see and celebrate your progress.\n\n<em>Learn more about pulmonary care through ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation at <a href=\"https://promedicaskillednursing.org/\">promedicaskillednursing.org</a>.</em>",

    "Title": "Returning To Play: Bouncing Back After an Injury",
    "Content": "Physical activity is one of the most important things people can do for their health. Active people generally live longer and are at less risk for serious health problems, including heart disease, type 2 diabetes and even some cancers. Whether it’s walking, running, biking or dancing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends adults get 30 minutes of exercise five times a week. But what happens when an injury threatens your return to activity?\n\nMost sports-related injuries are non-surgical injuries such as strains and sprains. These types of injuries occur in people of all ages, including many who participate in youth sports and weekend warrior activities. More serious injuries can also occur, with the most common injury being an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear, which affects the knee. More serious injuries typically require surgical intervention to assist in the healing process. Strains and sprains can often be managed with conservative treatments such as bracing and physical therapy.\n\nIt is extremely important to let an injury heal completely before returning to activity. Failure to let an injury heal can lead to worsening of the injury or a more serious injury to the affected extremity. Once an injury is completely healed, the risk of reinjury is very low due to rehabilitation that focuses on normalizing the mechanics of the injured area and the surrounding areas to help prevent further injury.\n\nSports-related injuries should be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the severity of the injury and appropriate treatment plan. Receiving an accurate diagnosis is paramount to expediting the recovery process. Once an athlete does well with the initial treatment, there are return-to-play protocols that will gradually return the athlete back to full activity. While this process is overseen by a physician, for sports athletes, it is a multidisciplinary approach that also involves the athlete, family members, physical therapists, athletic trainers and coaches.\n\nOne of the best things a person can do at home to relieve pain associated with a minor injury is the RICE method.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>R</strong>est – Pain is the body signaling something is wrong. Once an injury occurs, it is best to stop all activity and rest as much as possible to prevent further injury. This can also prevent further bruising.</li>\n \t<li><strong>I</strong>ce – Ice is a great tool to reduce pain and swelling. Apply an ice pack for 15-20 minutes every couple of hours for the first two days following the injury.</li>\n \t<li><strong>C</strong>ompression – Wrap the injured area with an elastic medical bandage to prevent swelling. The wrap should be snug but not too tight to interrupt blood flow.</li>\n \t<li><strong>E</strong>levation – Keep the injured part of the body above the level of your heart when lying down. Doing so can reduce swelling.</li>\n</ul>\nKeep in mind that getting injured is sometimes part of life. Injury can be a devastating thing to deal with both mentally and physically, but there are plenty of healthcare professionals specializing in this area who are available to help injured individuals get back in the game.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/anil-k-gupta-md-mba-orthopaedic-surgery\">Dr. Anil Gupta</a> is an orthopaedic surgeon with ProMedica Physicians. </em>",

If you’d like a cold grain salad, cook the grain a day ahead and store in the refrigerator overnight.</li>\n \t<li>Choose the combination of vegetables you’d like. Shred, dice and chop into small pieces, and add to grain in a medium salad or mixing bowl. Do the same for any nuts, olives or dried fruit you’d like.</li>\n \t<li>In a small bowl, whisk together oil, lemon juice, vinegar and herbs. Pour over salad and toss.</li>\n \t<li>Taste!

    "Title": "Snacks and Satisfaction – How To Balance It All",
    "Content": "Sweet or salty? Regardless of your preference, snacking can get out of hand if you don’t set yourself up for success. Here are a few ways that you can make the most of your snacking.\n<h2>Be a Mindful Eater</h2>\nPut down that cellphone, turn off the TV and focus on the meal or snack that is in front of you. We are not as good at multi-tasking as we think we are. The distractions in front of us are often louder than our bodies’ cues which can lead to overeating. Mindful eating helps us listen to our body and give it the amount of fuel and nutrients that it needs at that moment. Set aside time to make preparing and consuming your food an enjoyable experience!\n<h2>Quit the Clean Plate Club</h2>\nDon’t be afraid to leave some food on your plate. You’re the only one who’s going to pay the price if you overeat. You can always box up your leftovers and save them for another day. Try putting less food on your plate or use a smaller plate to give that “full plate” appearance that we like to see.\n<h2>Add Movement to Your Meals</h2>\nStay active during the day and engage in more intense exercise at least several days a week. Prepare your meals from scratch, take a walk after an indulgent meal or walk to the ice cream shop to get moving.\n<h2>Be Choosy About Your Snacks</h2>\nA healthier snack is lower in sugar, higher in fiber and balanced with protein or fat. Stay away from processed sugars as much as possible and stick to natural sugars – they’re much easier for our bodies to digest. If you are craving a more indulgent snack, try making it at home! This way you can control the amount of sugar that goes into it. In most recipes, you can leave out about half of the sugar called for and it will still taste great!\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\nIt’s really all about balance - if you’re craving a piece of chocolate, eat the piece of chocolate! An apple most likely won’t tame your chocolate craving. You will end up consuming more calories in the long run by eating the apple now and the piece of chocolate later.\n\nFollowing these tips may help you feel much more satisfied and much less guilty after enjoying a snack. Learn to listen to your gut (literally) and eat what your body needs when your body needs it.",

    "Title": "Gardening Has Unique Benefits for Older Adults",
    "Content": "Gardening is an easy way to remain active throughout life. Planting, watering and tending to a garden is a great way to add activity to your daily routine and reduce the risks brought on by natural aging. The truth is, as we age our likelihood of remaining active decreases and fatigue sets in. With daily exercise and a healthy diet, older adults can avoid losing energy and keep a sharp mind.\n\nGardening provides many of these advantages and is an easy and enjoyable way to do so. Whether you decide that the front lawn could use a little color, or you want to see the cooking process from cultivation to the dinner table, gardening leaves the gardener with a feeling of accomplishment and potentially a full belly.\n\nKeep in mind that you don’t have to know how to garden to participate. There are many resources out there that take beginners step by step from planting to cultivation. Most seed packages even have instructions on the back for planting!\n<h2>The Benefits of Gardening</h2>\nThere are numerous benefits for starting your own garden, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Physical benefits:</strong> The American Heart Association recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise weekly, such as gardening, to reduce the risk of cardiovascular issues. An activity such as gardening helps promote flexibility, endurance and strength and has been used to help improve range of motion and coordination.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Mental health benefits:</strong> Gardening is a great mental workout, as well. It takes resourcefulness and imagination to tend to a garden. Gardening allows time for meditation, personal reflection and daydreaming that can help reduce stress and anxiety. Gardeners often experience feelings of accomplishment and creativity by producing something that they helped nurture for an extended period of time.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Nutritional benefits:</strong> When gardening crops, keep in mind that eating organic produce is just plain good for you. Fresh produce is not only high in vitamins and minerals but is also low in calories. Certain nutrients found in fresh organically produced foods can aid in disease prevention.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Benefits of nature:</strong> Benefits of being engaged in nature include better mood, sounder sleep, reduced risk of obesity and increased self-esteem through increased activity and decreased stress.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Relationship benefits:</strong> Gardening is also a great activity to bring the family closer. Try teaching a child or grandchild how to plant and water seeds in your garden. Time spent with family can be the best benefit of all.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Gardening Safely</h2>\nAs we age, it’s important to remember that even though gardening is a pleasurable and rewarding way to get physical activity, it does come with risks that need to be considered before digging in. Bugs, uneven ground, muscle strain, dangerous tools and chemicals are all problems that could arise when you are putting your green thumb to work.\n\nHere are some tips to ensure you enjoy gardening without stress or injury:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Wear protective gear such as goggles, gloves, ear plugs, sturdy shoes, long pants and long sleeves.</li>\n \t<li>Use insect repellent to protect yourself from mosquitoes and ticks.</li>\n \t<li>Wear sunscreen to reduce your risk of sunburn and skin cancer.</li>\n \t<li>Keep harmful chemicals out of the reach of children.</li>\n \t<li>Sharpen tools carefully.</li>\n \t<li>Follow instructions closely when using chemicals and equipment.</li>\n \t<li>Drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.</li>\n \t<li>Take breaks often.</li>\n \t<li>Lift with your knees.</li>\n \t<li>Consider using knee pads, a stool or a chair when working low to the ground.</li>\n</ul>\nGardening may seem like a lot of work, but the fruits of your labor will make the time you spend in the garden worth it. The vibrant colors bursting from the ground and the butterflies and bumble bees frolicking through the flowers are sure to bring a smile to your face, even on grey summer days.",

    "Title": "Tips to Spring Back Into Fitness",
    "Content": "Spring is in the air. With the warmer weather and longer days, many find themselves feeling reenergized and ready to get moving. Regular exercise has been shown to have countless health benefits. But, creating a fitness routine can be overwhelming. Whether starting a new routine or resuming a previous one, check out these five tips to start a routine off right.\n<h2>1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate.</h2>\nStaying well hydrated is important to ensure the body is functioning optimally. When exercising, the body loses water through sweat making it easy to become dehydrated without realizing it. Drinking water before, during and after a workout can help to replenish what is lost during the workout. How does one know if they are dehydrated? A good rule of thumb to check hydration status is to use your urine as a barometer. If urine is clear to a slight tinge of yellow, then the body is most likely well hydrated.\n<h2>2. Fuel the body.</h2>\nWhen initiating a new exercise regimen, it is important to maintain basic nutrition. Activity increases the body’s metabolism, which will require more of the essential macronutrients (proteins, carbohydrates and fats) to fuel and help repair the body post workout. When one does not consume enough protein, the body will resort to utilizing protein as an energy source, which will, in turn, break down muscle to meet the body’s energy needs. If an exercise goal is to build muscle and strength, this can be counterproductive. Questions regarding basic nutritional needs and goals are best answered by a physician or registered dietician who can assist in setting up a plan.\n<h2>3. Dress for success.</h2>\nIt is always important to consider the environment in which one will be exercising. Wearing short sleeves and shorts in hotter, more humid climates (in addition to remaining well hydrated) can help to decrease incidence of heat injury/illness. If planning to exercise in a wooded area, longer sleeves and pants should be considered to avoid insect exposure. Furthermore, if the sun is out, it’s recommended to use sunblock and appropriate eyewear, especially when the UV index is high.\n\nChoosing the appropriate footwear can be helpful in preventing injuries. It’s important to select shoes based on activity, body type, comfort and biomechanics. Proper footwear can also help to reduce incidence of chronic injuries such as shin splints, knee pain and plantar fasciitis.\n<h2>4. Start slow.</h2>\nTo begin any exercise program, always think about any exercise goals or desired achievements. Setting realistic goals can be humbling, but remember that the body’s capacity to recover and adapt changes with time and age. If one has not worked out recently, it would be best to start with a shorter duration of activity and/or intensity level. It is important to start slow and not do too much too soon. Consider the basic components of exercise that can be remembered by the acronym “FITT” (Frequency, Intensity, Time, Type). Increasing just one of these components at a time can help to decrease the risk of injury.\n\nSpeaking with a physician is especially important if one has underlying conditions or limitations, a physician can help determine what activities and durations would be optimal to start. Additionally, they can provide insight and resources, and help determine what kind of activity/exercise is best suited.\n<h2>5. Listen to the body.</h2>\nThe body can speak, well not exactly… The body has ways of letting one know when it has done too much or when a change of activity is needed. Muscle soreness is the body’s way of communicating that it is trying to adapt and recover from a workout. To assist in preventing muscle soreness and improve flexibility, it is essential to stretch before and after exercise.\n\nGetting plenty of rest and sleep is also important when trying to get back into fitness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most adults need seven or more hours of sleep per night. Musculoskeletal remodeling and repair occur while sleeping, meaning sleep deprivation can lead to delayed adaptations to exercise and slower injury healing.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/marshall-ochi-do-family-medicine\">Marshall Ochi, DO, CAQSM,</a> is a physician with the ProMedica Sports Medicine Institute.</em>",

    "Title": "Foods to Support Your Mental Health",
    "Content": "Can food affect our mental health?  Absolutely!\n\nHave you ever felt fatigued after eating? Ever felt jittery or anxious if you eat certain foods or wait a little too long to eat? Ever felt angry or irritable after eating a lot of processed foods? Food is fuel for our bodies as well as our brains so if we aren’t “feeding our minds” with healthier choices we may see that reflected in our moods.\n\nHere are some foods that may have an impact on how you are feeling without you even knowing it!\n<h2>Sugar</h2>\nSugar tends to be a significant part of the American meal plan. Certainly, it can affect your blood sugars if you have diabetes, but even if you don’t there are still dips and spikes in blood sugars that may contribute to mood changes.  Your blood sugars can spike to the “high end of normal” and then drop to the “lower end” and that can trigger feelings of depression, anxiety or irritability.\n\nSugar is considered a root cause of chronic inflammation as well. This will impact the immune system, brain and many body systems.  Decreasing sugar consumption has been shown to positively influence pain management, arthritis and heart disease.\n<h2>Fatty Fish</h2>\nFatty fish like salmon, herring, cod and albacore tuna are rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids are essential fats that you must obtain through your diet because your body can’t produce them on its own. The two types of omega-3s, DHA and EPA, are linked to lower levels of depression.\n<h2>Fermented Foods</h2>\n<a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/8-fermented-foods\">Fermented foods</a> include kimchi, yogurt, kefir and kombucha and may improve gut health and mood. Our “gut” is the “brains of our digestion” so again when we feed the “brain” well it responds in kind with improving our health.\n\nThe fermentation process encourages live bacteria to thrive in foods and during this process, <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/11-super-healthy-probiotic-foods\">probiotics</a> are created. Probiotics are “healthy bacteria” for our gut so digestion is improved, and “regularity” is often restored. There is some research that states that improving “gut bacteria” increases serotonin levels, which is a neurotransmitter that affects our mood, stress response, appetite and sexual drive. Upwards of 90% of your body’s serotonin is produced by the collection of healthy bacteria in your gut.\n<h2>Oats</h2>\nOats are an excellent source of fiber. Fiber helps slow your digestion of carbohydrates, allowing for a gradual release of sugar into the bloodstream to keep your energy levels stable. Oats are also a significant source of iron, which helps to prevent iron deficiency anemia, one of the most common <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-common-nutrient-deficiencies\">nutrient deficiencies</a>. Iron deficiency anemia’s symptoms include fatigue, sluggishness and mood disorders\n<h2>Berries</h2>\nConsuming “balanced meals” that include more fruits and vegetables have been linked to lower rates of depression. A meal plan that includes a variety of foods rich in antioxidants (as fruits and vegetables are) may help to manage inflammation which, as we discussed above, can be associated with higher rates of mood disorders.\n<h2>Beans and Lentils</h2>\nIn addition to being high in fiber and plant-based protein, they are an excellent source of B vitamins, which helps to improve mood by increasing levels of neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), all of which are important for regulating mood. <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/vitamin-b-complex\">B vitamins</a> play a key role in nerve signaling, which allows proper communication between nerve cells. Low levels of B12 and folate have been shown to increase mood disorders, such as depression. Beans and lentils are also a good source of zinc, magnesium, selenium, and non-heme iron, which may also improve your spirits.\n\nAs you can see, there are several foods that may assist with improving your mood. With a little practice and some “increased awareness” of how foods make you feel, I’m sure there are many more that you will find helpful to leading you along a path of more mental clarity and increased joy!\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "The Benefits of Community Fitness",
    "Content": "These past few years of COVID-19 has taught us many things, one of them being that we enjoy gathering with others. This was harder to accomplish due to the shutdown of many facilities and the need for social distancing, but fitness communities did their best to keep that interaction through virtual online classes and running outdoor events. As a certified personal trainer and exercise medicine specialist at ProMedica ForeverFit, I’ve been reminded of the many benefits of community fitness. Here are just a few.\n<h2>More Motivation</h2>\nIf you didn’t participate in any virtual classes, you may have experienced how hard it can be to find the motivation to get outside and go for a walk or to use the weight equipment in your house and if you were like me, you used every excuse not to exercise and tell yourself “I’ll start tomorrow.” There is something to be said about the power of working out in a community that motivates us.\n<h2>Shared Goals</h2>\nThe sense of community you find at a fitness center can provide you with the inspiration and support you need to not only push you to start working out, but also be there to celebrate your achievements as you progress through your fitness journey. Whether your goal is to be able to complete a 5K or increase your overall strength, you will find camaraderie with those in your fitness community that may have similar goals. These individuals will be there each week to encourage you to increase your running tempo or add more weight and before you know it, those fitness goals you once thought were unattainable are now within reach.\n\nThe best part is the friends you make at the club are right beside you giving you that high five and pat on the back when you cross the finish line of your first race or lifted more than you thought you were capable of. Accomplishing your goal can be an intimidating task, but it’s much easier to do it with a community supporting you every step of the way.\n<h2>Sense of Belonging</h2>\nGroup exercise classes also promotes a sense of belonging where you become part of a club within a club. Taking the same classes each week with the same people promotes a feeling that “we’re all in this together.” When you’re on the last round of a boot camp class and your losing energy, the other class participants, who very quickly become your friends, are right there beside you performing each repetition with you, encouraging you to keep going.\n\nWhether you take aqua-robics, Barre or even chair yoga, that friendship and support encourages you to come to class, even when you don’t feel like it. You know you will be missed if you don’t show up. My group exercise community is there for me when I need a little more encouragement and I promise to be there for them.\n<h2>More Fun!</h2>\nBeing part of a fitness center community can be a lot of fun, too.  It is not all hard work and exercise; there is a lot laughing and joking.  When you spend that much time with the same people every week, it makes coming to class a lot of fun. As a matter of fact, one of my members just told me, “I’ve made really good friends at the club and I can’t wait to get there every day to see them.”\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"3\" sm=\"3\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-8454 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/FFNicoleNoGraphics-214x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"214\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"9\" sm=\"9\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Nicole Breeden, ACSM, is a certified personal trainer and exercise medicine specialist at ProMedica ForeverFit.</em>\n[/column]\n[/row]",

    "Title": "How to Handle Feeling Out of Control With Food",
    "Content": "Here we are again – the start of a new year, fresh with possibility, calling out for a “new way of living” and endless in its opportunities. So, we start our new “eating plan,” sign up for a new gym membership and set a new bedtime of 10 p.m. every night no matter what. Then life happens, and we realize that as much as we<em> want </em>to “do it all,” we simply don’t do well when we overwhelm ourselves with changing everything at once.\n\nTake eating out for example. If you are a person who eats out frequently, “stopping cold turkey” and telling yourself you will only eat out once a month will soon have you ordering from Grub Hub and having it delivered to work or stopping at the drive-thru for a “pre-dinner snack” on your way home.  It doesn’t have to be all or nothing!\n\nWhat about sweets? You know, all those tasty treats that were in HUGE abundance in December? They are still available at every establishment that sells food. Telling yourself you won’t eat another cookie until 2023 probably won’t work.\n\nWhat if this is the year that you start to look at food in a whole new way? What if this year you start the year thinking of food as fuel?  And as something that you can ENJOY and BALANCE with foods that nourish your body as well as provide JOY. Because let’s face it, when you want a cookie, you want a cookie, not fruit as a “sweet” replacement!\n\nSo, I encourage you to consider three things when you are feeling out of control with these types of food choices:\n<h2>Is this really what you want to eat?</h2>\nAre you eating several foods prior to eating what you really want to eat? For example, a cookie might have 150-200 calories, depending on what type of cookie it is. Are you eating fruit with peanut butter, veggies and dip, snack crackers and cheese and THEN having the cookie because that is ultimately the craving you had in the first place? If so, your 150-200 calorie cookie has turned into a 500 calorie “snack.”\n\n<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 31.5px; font-weight: bold;\">Are you really hungry?</span>\n\nOr are you bored, tired, frustrated, angry, sad, or anxious? If you are really hungry, then you need to eat.  If you are any of the other emotions listed above, then you need to find ways to deal with that emotion and it won’t be found in the kitchen. When we eat foods to self-soothe (aka feed our emotions) we aren’t eating for enjoyment, we are eating to cover up our feelings. Calling a friend, taking a walk, taking a nap, telling someone (even your dog) that you are angry and why, will be more helpful than eating.  Hunger is hunger. Emotional healing requires empathy, love, and support, not chips.\n\n<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 31.5px; font-weight: bold;\">You CAN eat what you want and still be eating healthy.</span>\n\nDiets are short-term agendas. Eating healthy is a lifelong endeavor. Just like walking a mile and calling it good for the year doesn’t make you physically fit, eating one bag of chips won’t erase all of your effort when it comes to eating differently.\n\nGrace goes a long way. If you find yourself berating yourself for how you are eating, I encourage you to explore why you are doing that. You deserve to be kind to yourself, just like you are kind to others.  Make 2022 the year that you stop feeling guilty about what you are eating and listen to what your body actually needs. And I’m here to tell you, sometimes it really is a cookie!\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "Building Your Weight Loss Plan",
    "Content": "When it comes to losing weight, it’s tempting to seek a quick fix with dramatic results.  But, usually, making slow, lifestyle changes are what lead to long-term success. Having a plan of action can help. Here are five tips for building your weight loss plan.\n<h2>Talk with your doctor first.</h2>\nIt’s best to consult with your doctor before beginning any diet or exercise program. They can help build a weight loss plan that’s customized to your fitness level, nutrition needs, medical conditions, and lifestyle. If you already have a diet or exercise program in mind, explain it to your doctor or take it with you to your next appointment. They can also address any potential risks and point you to helpful resources before you get started.\n<h2>Set goals.</h2>\nDon’t just focus on losing weight; focus on a healthy makeover. Set realistic goals, changing your actions little by little until they become healthy habits. Make sure your goals are specific so that you can easily gauge if you’ve achieved them. An example of a healthy goal may be to walk for 30 minutes, five days a week, rather than just saying you’ll “walk more”. Having goals will help you stay focused and will give you a basis of measurement to take pride in your weight loss progress.\n<h2>Be accountable.</h2>\nJoin a weight-loss support group, work out with a buddy, or keep a food journal. It’s easy to let yourself slide when you don’t have to account for yourself, but knowing that your friend is waiting at the gym will keep you going.\n<h2>Identify triggers.</h2>\nWhen you watch television at night do you tend to nibble mindlessly? When having a bad day at work, does exercise seem overwhelming? Make a conscious effort to avoid stressors or reduce their impact as best as you can. Take a walk in the evening instead of watching TV, or practice deep breathing to relax after a confrontation. If you aren’t sure of your triggers, keep a food and exercise journal to see if there are any patterns in the way you feel or act.\n<h2>Reward yourself.</h2>\nMaking lifestyle changes is tough work. Keep a positive attitude about your new lifestyle and reward yourself for reaching your goals. But don’t give in to the temptation of using unhealthy food as a reward. Instead, go to a movie or have a spa day. Even better – find a way to incorporate your next goal into your reward, such as buying new workout clothes.\n\nWeight loss is a journey. Start your journey today by making an appointment with your doctor to discuss a building a plan that’s best for you.",

    "Title": "7 Fall Foods to Add to Your Meal Plan",
    "Content": "Chill is in the air and leaves are changing to brilliant colors of red, orange and yellow. Fall is here! From pumpkin spice flavors to football games, there are many traditions that happen this time of the year. Adding nutritious, seasonal foods to your snacks and meals can be one of them!\n\nAlong with autumn’s temperature changes, comes the beginning of challenges to our immune system.  Cold and flu season is coming into full swing and there are several things we can do to help improve our immunity and give us a greater chance of staying healthy as we all are inside more often.\n\nHere are some of the top foods to consider including in your meals more often this time of the year:\n\n<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 31.5px; font-weight: bold;\">1. Citrus Fruits</span>\n\nFortunately, they are plentiful this time of the year and are an easy addition to any meal. Citrus fruits contain Vitamin C which is involved in the repair of body tissues. Vitamin C helps with the formation of collagen (which is important for healthy joints), iron absorption (which helps oxygen flow through our blood stream more efficiently, improving circulation and preventing fatigue) and improve your immune system (which makes it easier to recover from a cold or the flu). We need to eat foods with vitamin C daily because your body can’t store it and does not produce it. The recommended daily amount is 75 mg for women and 90 mg for men.\n\nHow can you incorporate more citrus fruits into your meals?\n<ul>\n \t<li>Add a squeeze of lemon or lime to your water.</li>\n \t<li>Add an orange to your breakfast or lunch.</li>\n \t<li>Put clementine wedges on your salad.</li>\n \t<li>Add red bell peppers to your meal either raw or in a stir fry.</li>\n \t<li>Try to avoid citrus juices because they tend to add extra calories but don’t provide all of the fiber, vitamins and minerals available to you from fresh, whole fruits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2. Broccoli</h2>\nBroccoli is packed with vitamins A, C and E, as well as fiber. Raw or steamed is the best way to prevent nutrient loss in broccoli. The closer it is to its “whole” state the more nutritious it is.\n<h2><span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 31.5px;\">3. Ginger</span></h2>\nGinger may help decrease inflammation which can help reduce sore throat pain. It may also help with nausea. Ginger tastes great in tea (another warm fluid to help ease a sore throat or stuffy nose).\n<h2>4. Spinach</h2>\nSpinach is another great source of Vitamin C, but it also has antioxidants and beta carotene, both of which help with immunity building.\n<h2>5. Yogurt</h2>\nYogurt has “live and active cultures” that can help stimulate your immune system. They also contain probiotics that are great for “gut health.” A healthy gut contributes to a strong immune system and a greater ability to fight off viruses. Try to avoid “dessert” yogurts that are loaded with added sugars and sweeten instead with fruit or a drizzle of honey.\n<h2>6. Turmeric</h2>\nTurmeric can be used in curries or sprinkled on eggs.  It can also be taken in supplement form.  Turmeric has anti-inflammatory properties as well.\n<h2>7. Chicken noodle soup</h2>\nIt is true that chicken noodle soup is a healthy choice when it comes to soothing cold symptoms and building immunity. The trick is how it’s prepared, though. When chicken noodle soup is made with fresh chicken (that contains vitamin B-6 that helps with the formation of red blood cells that helps bring oxygen throughout your body) and bone broth (which provides collagen that is rich in immunity building properties), then it is helpful with helping you feel better. It’s also comforting to sip something warm when we feel chilled or have a sore throat. Unfortunately, the canned varieties of chicken noodle soup are not as effective, but they do provide warmth and some calories if appetite is decreased.\n\nThese Fall foods offer delicious flavors and may help your immune system tackle seasonal germs. So enjoy a walk through the crunchy leaves or a hot tea while reading your favorite book, but also find ways to incorporate seasonal favorites into your Fall traditions. Happy Fall, everyone!\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

Since 1820, U.S. Pharmacopeia has ensured standards of ingredient levels, quality and safety.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Calcium supplement pills can cause constipation, and the large pills may be hard to swallow. Chewable gummy types of calcium may be more tolerable and easier to swallow. You can also try calcium citrate or liquid calcium supplements. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n<h3>Vitamin D</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Vitamin D helps you absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from being out in the sun, from supplements and from a few foods, including: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Eggs and egg yolks.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Fortified cereals.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Salmon.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Mackerel.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Trout. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>If You’re Lactose-Intolerant</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Although dairy foods like whole milk, cream, yogurt and cheese are high in calcium, they’re not an option if you’re lactose intolerant. That said, you still have plenty of food options, including foods fortified with calcium and Vitamin D. These include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Almond milk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cooked beans.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Cereals.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Hard cheeses like swiss, parmesan and cheddar.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Leafy greens like kale or spinach.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Nuts like almonds, pistachios and walnuts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Oranges and orange juice.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Seafood such as salmon, canned tuna or shrimp.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yogurt with active cultures.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">“Our hope,” says Jones, “is that those with lactose intolerance in future generations can get some of these foods in their diet from a young age. This can help improve bone density early on, compared to people who are 50 and older who didn’t have these fortified food options when they were younger.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n<h2>Exercise and Balance for Bone Health</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">In addition to diet, exercise can help build your bone density, but it’s important you do the right kind of exercise. When it comes to your bone health, walking and weightlifting are good options, because you’re putting weight on your bones. Other lower-impact exercises aren’t as effective.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">“Even though swimming and water aerobics can help relieve joint pain from arthritis,” says Jones, “they’re not as good for the bones because they’re low impact. You’re not putting your weight on your bones like you would with other exercise.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Age also affects our sense of balance. To strengthen your muscles, increase your endurance, and restore or strengthen your sense of balance, try exercises like knee curls, leg stretches and yoga. “You can also sign up for balance classes at a gym or community center, sometimes free through Medicare,” says Jones.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span>\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kristie-jones-pa-c-orthopaedic-surgery\">Kristie Jones, PA-C,</a> is an <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/orthopaedics\">orthopaedic</a> surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-orthopaedic-surgery-adrian\">ProMedica Physicians Orthopaedic Surgery - Adrian</a>.</em>",

    "Title": "Tips for Cutting Back on Caffeine",
    "Content": "<span data-contrast=\"none\">For many of us, a morning cup of coffee is a beloved ritual. For others, sipping a caffeinated beverage in the afternoon offers a much-needed quick pick-me-up. No matter how you use caffeine, the reason you use it is likely the same: It helps you get — and stay — energized and focused.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">But caffeine also comes with some not-so-nice effects, like insomnia, headache and even irregular heartbeat.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“While some individuals believe that caffeine has no effect on them, others may not be able to tolerate a single cup of tea or coffee,” says certified nurse practitioner Ehden Iachini, MSN, FNP-C. “Every individual responds differently to caffeine.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">If your caffeine intake is taking a physical toll, it may be time to cut back.</span>\n<h2>Sources of Caffeine</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers up to 400 milligrams of caffeine each day as safe for most healthy adults. If you’re pregnant, the American College of Gynecology recommends limiting your caffeine intake to no more than 200 milligrams a day. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">To help you put that in perspective, here are common drinks and their caffeine content.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<table style=\"height: 128px;\" width=\"383\" data-tablestyle=\"MsoTableGrid\" data-tablelook=\"1184\" aria-rowcount=\"5\">\n<tbody>\n<tr aria-rowindex=\"1\">\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Drink</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Caffeine</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr aria-rowindex=\"2\">\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Coffee (eight ounces)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">80 to 100 milligrams</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr aria-rowindex=\"3\">\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Energy drink (eight ounces)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">40 to 250 milligrams</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr aria-rowindex=\"4\">\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Green or black tea (eight ounces)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\">   </span></td>\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">30 to 50 milligrams</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr aria-rowindex=\"5\">\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Soft drink (12 ounces)</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n<td data-celllook=\"0\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">30 to 40 milligrams</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Some supplements and medicines may also contain caffeine, so be sure to read the labels.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Even drinks labeled “decaf” can still contain some caffeine, just less of it.

    "Title": "Protecting the Brain With the MIND Diet",
    "Content": "<span data-contrast=\"auto\">There are currently around 5 million Americans over age 65 with dementia. Recently, much research has been put into the prevention of this disease. Lifestyle and diet are two of the best ways to prevent dementia. The MIND diet, which stands for</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"none\">Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, combines two well-known diets - the Mediterranean Diet and the DA</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">SH diet. The Mediterranean diet follows the diet principles of those living in the Mediterranean and is found to be one of the healthiest diet patterns. The DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) was created by the National Institutes of Health to prevent high blood pressure.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h2>Benefits of the Mind Diet</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">The MIND diet takes principles from each diet which have been proven to help slow down cognitive decline. One study showed that those who closely follow the diet scored better on cognitive tests to the equivalent of being 7 ½ years younger than those who do not follow the diet pattern. Another study found that those who follow the diet strictly have a 53% less chance of developing Alzheimer’s. Even better news is that the same study found those who even moderately followed the diet had a 35% less chance of developing Alzheimer’s. This shows that even a few, small dietary changes can make a big difference.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h2>Following MIND Diet Patterns</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">According to the MIND diet, incorporating some of the following foods may help prevent dementia: </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Green Leafy Vegetables</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">It is recommended to have one serving (one cup) of green leafy vegetables per day, as these have been found to slow down aging in the brain. Green leafy vegetables such as spinach, kale, collards and leaf lettuce have nutrients like vitamin E and folate which are protective against inflammation. Unsure how to get in leafy greens everyday? Try a side salad with dinner, scrambling into eggs at breakfast, or adding to a smoothie. In terms of other vegetables, it is recommended to have one serving everyday as well. Try roasting some veggies as a side dish, stir frying a medley of vegetables, or adding tomatoes and bell peppers to pasta dishes.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Berries</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another food that is recommended is berries. While all fruits have beneficial vitamins, minerals, and fiber, berries in particular are high in antioxidants, which can help prevent damage to cells in the body, including those in the brain. One study showed that berry intake helped improve memory and learning in animals. Aim for at least two servings per week. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Fish</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Fish is recommended once per week, and researchers have found no benefit to brain health in having more frequent consumption. Fish contains omega fatty acids which can prevent plaque build up in the brain which is a key feature in Alzheimer’s Disease. Go for oily fish such as salmon, tuna, or sardines. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Olive Oil</h3>\nWhen cooking, use olive oil as much as possible over butter and other cooking oils. Olive oil is high in antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. Opt for extra virgin olive oil, which is the least processed variety. Aside from cooking, use olive oil in dressings and marinades as well.<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\" data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Nuts</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Nuts are another food that is high in healthy fats and brain-healthy vitamins and minerals. Studies recommend having five servings of nuts per week. While that may sound like a lot, one serving is just ¼ cup, or about the size of the palm of your hand. Try having a handful of nuts as a snack, sprinkling on a salad, or adding to oatmeal. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Beans</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Going meatless a few days a week and getting plant protein from beans can also boost cognitive function. In fact, one study found those who had low intakes of beans had greater cognitive decline. Beans have B vitamins, which are helpful for brain health. Aim for three servings per week. Not ready to go full meatless? Try beans as a side dish with tacos, in a salad, or as a dip. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:276}\"> </span>\n<h3>Whole Grains</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whole grains are also full of B vitamins and antioxidants. Studies recommend getting three servings of whole grains per day. One serving of whole grains is ½ cup brown rice or other grain, one slice of bread, ½ cup oatmeal, or 1 cup dry cereal.

    "Title": "Helping Seniors Get Enough Protein in Their Diet",
    "Content": "Protein is an important aspect of anyone’s diet, but with aging it can become challenging to consume enough. The elderly have different needs than the general population, and getting enough protein can help seniors stay independent. Protein helps prevent weight loss and skin breakdown, which can lead to pressure sores. Protein also helps to limit sarcopenia, which is the gradual loss of muscle that occurs as people age. Preserving muscle mass is important to prevent falls and continue to perform activities of daily living (ADLs).\n<h2>How much protein do seniors need?</h2>\nProtein needs for adults is generally 0.8g of protein per kilogram of body weight. This increases in the elderly to anywhere from 1.0-1.5g of protein per kilogram of body weight. To convert pounds to kilograms, divide the weight in pounds by 2.2. Keep in mind that certain chronic illnesses, such as chronic kidney disease, have different protein requirements.\n<h2>Why is it hard to eat enough protein?</h2>\nFor some elderly people, it can be difficult to consume enough protein. Due to natural changes that occur with aging, taste preferences may change. It is common to want more sweet than savory foods, which can lead to a decrease in meat and protein intake. The elderly have more difficulty with food preparation and set up, which can lead to skipping meals. Also, changes in dentition can make chewing more difficult.\n<h2>What are some ways to add protein to the diet?</h2>\nWhile there are a wide variety of protein supplement drinks available, generally it is beneficial to consume food sources of protein over supplements. The following strategies can be used to help increase protein in the elderly:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Make a high-protein smoothie</strong>. Smoothies are great since they are easy to customize. Add a protein source such as milk, yogurt, or peanut butter with fruit and some greens for a protein- and vitamin- packed drink.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Alter the texture of meats.</strong> It may be difficult for some to chew tough cuts of meat such as steak or pork chops. Opt for ground meat, or tender cuts in a stew or soup. Adding extra sauce or gravy can also make it easier to chew.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Include between-meal snacks.</strong> If it is difficult to get large amounts of protein in during meals, include 2-3 high protein snacks throughout the day. Try foods like hard-boiled eggs, half of a sandwich, yogurt, cottage cheese, or a tuna packet.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Try vegetarian options.</strong> Plant-based protein sources such as tofu, lentils, and beans are versatile and are soft enough for people with chewing difficulties. Tofu is great in stir fry, while lentils and beans work well in soups, stews, and as a side dish.</li>\n</ul>\nMaking sure seniors eat enough protein, in addition to a well-balanced diet and staying hydrated, is important for healthy aging. Dietitians at ProMedica Senior Care are experts in nutrition and can help answer questions about healthy diets. If your loved one is staying at a <a href=\"https://www.promedicaseniorcare.org/\">ProMedica Senior Care facility</a>, speak with a dietitian to learn how they can help.",

    "Title": "Easing Back Into Movement After a Physical Setback",
    "Content": "If you’ve had surgery or experienced a health event like a sprain or bone fracture, you naturally want to get back to your regular routine ASAP. But depending on factors like your age and overall physical condition, you might not be able to just pick up where you left off. Learn how to get back to your daily activities and exercise safely.\n<h2>Start moving now.</h2>\nWhenever you experience a physical setback, the sooner you get back to moving, the better. And you don’t have to do it all on your own. Physical therapy professionals can help you get back into motion gradually and safely, with a customized recovery plan designed with your unique condition, fitness level and goals in mind.\n\nEven if you’ve had hip or knee replacement surgery, you may be surprised how quickly you’ll be encouraged to get back on your feet. Recovery doesn’t include lounging around the hospital for a few days anymore.\n\n“Fifteen years ago, everyone thought resting for a few days was better,\" says Sheree Robinson, a physical therapy assistant with ProMedica. “But now we get patients up for physical therapy that same day because that’s going to start the healing process sooner.”\n<h3>Define your goals.</h3>\nWhat are your expectations for activities? Do you get to want to be able to cook your meals again? Do you want to resume working full time?\n\nYou may need physical therapy and exercise to improve your range of motion and endurance to return to activities of daily living. This includes going up and down stairs, getting in and out of a car, cooking your family’s meals, sitting down and standing up and driving — all the little things we take for granted.\n<h3>Change your behavior.</h3>\nIf you’re recovering from injury, surgery or another event, it can be difficult to get back to normal. After all, recovery is not just physical, it’s also mental. “You're changing your lifestyle, whether it's temporary or long term,” says Robinson. “You have to be willing to change your thinking about what you may or may not be able to do.”\n<h2>Discover the balance between moving too much or too little.</h2>\nIn order to get stronger, you have to work and stretch your muscles. “Your muscle has memory,” Robinson says. “And you’re giving it a new memory. But just like taking a class or a course, you have to do it a little bit at a time.”\n\nThis is your happy medium of exercise – not too much, not too little. “You always think if it's good for you, more is better but that’s not the case,” says Robinson. “You need to find that happy medium of easing your way into it and just starting off slowly.”\n\nWhen walking, for example, step it up over a few days to 15 minutes, 20 minutes and then 30 minutes — and see how you feel the next day or two after each increase. When you’re in the right zone, you should feel some muscle soreness over the next day or two. However, if you feel pain or numbness, you’ve gone too far and will need to back off. Remember, pain is your body’s way of telling you to stop doing something.\n\n“The goal is to fix it, not break it,” Robinson says, “But people think they have to push it so far they can't go anymore. And that's doesn’t work.”\n<h2>Recover well, stay healthy.</h2>\nIt’s normal to feel depression and anxiety when you have back pain or pain from an injury or surgery. But once you start to move and exercise, you’ll begin to feel better. To get — and stay — healthy, you have to be motivated to move.\n\n“Exercise is an effective treatment for depression and anxiety,” says Robinson. “It releases endorphins and helps you feel motivated.”\n\nOnce you return to work or your normal activity, it’s up to you to remember what you have learned and continue to make small, meaningful changes. “Sometimes it's something as simple as just choosing what you do during the day, like whether to stand up or sit down at work,” Robinson says. “Or to choose a parking spot farther away from the grocery store.”\n<h2>Make an appointment or learn more.</h2>\nRecovery is a marathon, not a sprint. But with a physical therapist as your guide, you can work toward a new routine that helps you keep moving.  “Sometimes having that guidance makes all the difference,” says Robinson.\n\n<em>If you need help with recover or have questions about getting back to the life you love after surgery or an injury, we’re were to help.

Cook, turning over once, until brown, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken and onion mixture to a plate and brown the remaining chicken. Discard any remaining marinade. Return the first batch of chicken to the second batch of chicken in the pan and add 1/2 cup water.</li>\n \t<li>Cover and cook until the meat is cooked through. Add the vegetables and toss with the chicken. Cook for 1 minute, stirring, or until everything is heated through. Serve immediately with steamed rice.</li>\n</ol>\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n<em>*This post is part of a paid partnership.</em>\n<h2>Leading Change in Health Care</h2>\nHealth starts where we live, learn, work, play -- and cook!

    "Title": "A Beginner's Guide to Running",
    "Content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’re someone who has never been into running, it can be scary to try and get started. However, there are many benefits to this form of exercise. Not only physical and mental health benefits, but also cost-effective ones. Running can be done anywhere and costs nothing once you’ve purchased the right shoes. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Amanda Ballard, a group fitness instructor at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-foreverfit\">ProMedica ForeverFit,</a> runs the Couch to 5K program. She used the program herself to begin running nine years ago, and now facilitates team and camaraderie-centered workouts to motivate people to get in shape. Ballard recognizes </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the health benefits and believes that through proper preparation and understanding the mental block that comes with running, anyone can get into it. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you're new to running, here's how Ballard recommends getting started.</span>\n<h2>Know the benefits of running.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running has many benefits. It can improve cardiovascular health and strength, reduce stress and improve your mental health, and tone muscle. Your core muscles are also improved because they work to keep you balanced. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Running is one of the least expensive forms of exercise,” says Ballard. “A pair of good running shoes is all that is required.” </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Beyond that, you can run anywhere – at the gym if you have a membership or outside in neighborhoods or parks.</span>\n<h2>Prepare for your runs.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to best prepare, Ballard recommends hydration. Though hydration and nutrition are important with any sport, it's especially important with running. Ensuring you are properly hydrated before a run can help prevent muscle cramps and fatigue. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Drinking a glass of water an hour before a run can help tremendously,” says Ballard.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Aside from a good pair of running shoes, Ballard recommends avoiding baggy pants that may fall down or a hood that could bother you in the wind. Instead, try moisture wicking clothing that has ventilation.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Additionally, dynamic warmups can be very helpful before a run. Ballard recommends a light jog, some knee lifts or downward facing dog to stretch first. </span>\n<h2>Pace yourself.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Preparation is especially important if you’re wanting to run the ideal amount Ballard recommends for beginners: two to three times per week. On other days, Ballard recommends doing stretching, strength training or cross training. However, Ballard believes people should listen to their bodies and rest when necessary. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“If your body is telling you that something is sore and you push it further, you may be risking injury,” says Ballard.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ballard also recommends being cleared by a doctor before starting to run.</span>\n<h2>Run for time, not for speed.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For beginners, Ballard recommends slowing down a bit and working for a time goal instead of a distance. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rather than sprinting to meet a goal in a certain amount of time, just see how far you can go at a reasonable pace. Gradually increasing the time will eventually increase the distance, and hopefully lead to a faster pace once the person has more running experience under their belt.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Many people start out fast and then get frustrated when they cannot run far,” says Ballard. “A slower pace can work wonders. A run/walk interval can be beneficial to many runners as well and help them increase their overall running time.”</span>\n<h2>Beat those mental blocks.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though there are some good methods to start running, mental blocks can be a huge problem in keeping up with the exercise. Ballard believes adding a new goal may help with motivation. She also recommends switching up your routine or changing the scenery, as well as adding cross training and not only doing running as your sole form of exercise. </span>",

    "Title": "6 Surprising Facts About Bariatric Surgery",
    "Content": "If you’ve ever wondered if weight-loss surgery is the right option for you or a family member, you’re in the right place. Bariatric surgery helps many people achieve long-term weight loss and reduce health problems. But what’s it like to go through it?\n\nWe checked in with ProMedica Physicians to learn more — and picked up some surprising facts.\n<h2>1. Many people could benefit from bariatric surgery.</h2>\nWeight-loss surgery is often an option for folks with a BMI (body mass index) of 35 or higher, which includes a large proportion of Americans. You don’t need to have an extreme case of obesity to benefit from bariatric surgery, says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-fourman-md-facs-fasmbs-bariatric-surgery\">Matthew Fourman, MD,</a> a bariatric surgeon with ProMedica Physicians.\n\n“A huge number of people don’t realize they could benefit from this lifesaving, life-changing surgery. If you look nationwide, less than one percent of the patients that could have it actually get it. There are many more people who could be getting help sooner,” he says.\n<h2>2. The risks are lower than you might think.</h2>\nOne misconception that keeps some people from looking into bariatric surgery is the idea that it’s dangerous. But it’s not as risky as you may think.\n\nWhen you look at the data, bariatric surgery carries about an equal risk as having a gallbladder taken out or having a hip replacement. By and large, the surgeries are actually considered very safe and low risk when done by experienced surgeons, like those at ProMedica.\n<h2>3. It’s a life-long change that goes beyond weight loss.</h2>\nBariatric surgery isn’t a “quick fix,” since you must be ready to commit to healthy eating and exercising afterward. But the benefits it brings may greatly improve many weight-related conditions that impact your well-being, everyday quality of life and long-term health.\n\n“After the surgery, it is so great to see folks not just achieve their weight loss goals, but they can also say, ‘I’m no longer on any medicine for my diabetes, I’m off my blood pressure medicines, my heart is healthy, and I got rid of my sleep apnea.’ It truly changes their lives,” Dr. Fourman says.\n<h2>4. You’ll have support before, during and after your surgery.</h2>\nThere are several different types of bariatric surgery, including minimally invasive options. Your doctor will talk to you about the best choice for you. The first year after your surgery and beyond, they will keep a close eye on your progress to help you stay on track with your weight loss.\n\nAt ProMedica, dietitians are also on hand to help you get used to new eating plans, and monthly support groups connect you to other people on similar weight-loss journeys. Together, this support helps the changes you’re making last for a lifetime.\n<h2>5. Most insurance plans cover the costs.</h2>\nMany people want to know: Is it expensive? Luckily, bariatric surgery is now covered by most insurance plans, which means you only pay for costs related to your deductible and copays. Your doctor will walk you through the steps to get your surgery approved by your insurer.\n<h2>6. Help might be closer than you realize.</h2>\nGiven the benefits that bariatric surgery can offer, ProMedica is now working to expand its northwest Ohio program in Michigan, including in Adrian and Monroe, to help reach and serve more people close to home with the right care and expertise.\n\n“The reality is obesity isn’t just about calories. Obesity is a metabolic disease, a physiologic disease and a genetic disease and needs to be addressed as such,” he says. “We understand and we’re here to help you.”\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"<a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/yourhealth/bariatrics\">www.promedica.org/yourhealth/bariatrics</a>\"] Learn More about Bariatric Surgery[/button]</p>",

    "Title": "Healthy Summer Food Swaps To Satisfy Your Taste Buds",
    "Content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re on vacation, it’s normal to ditch your regular meals in favor of eating unhealthy food. That’s why when summer vacation rolls around, it can be easy for people to forget about their healthy habits – food included.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chloe Plummer, MS, RD, LD, works with clients through the ProMedica Food Clinic, where she provides healthy food to patients who screen for food insecurity at their ProMedica doctor’s office. It may be a patient who is struggling to consistently put healthy food on the table for their family, or someone who is having to make the difficult decision between buying groceries and paying for medications. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Food Clinic also provides nutrition education and healthy eating information to help families make healthy choices long-term, so Plummer is no stranger to healthy substitution suggestions that can make a huge difference for your health. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Consider swapping just two cans of regular soda for two cans of sparkling water every day,” says Plummer. “This would reduce your calorie intake by about 300 calories each day. It would also mean 20 teaspoons worth of sugar eliminated from your diet daily.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are more of Plummer’s helpful food substitution tips that can make a huge difference.</span>\n<h2>The summer season has perfect swaps for food.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When thinking of good snacks for summer, Plummer imagines fresh fruits and vegetables first. With the wide variety in season, it’s less expensive than other times of the year to buy fresh. Many fruits and vegetables are also at their peak flavor. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“It is also easy to buy fresh, local fruits and vegetables by stopping by a local farmer’s market,” says Plummer. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">She also suggests replacing chips and dip with crunchy slices of cucumbers or celery and hummus. Additionally, Plummer suggests trying watermelon instead of candy or sweets.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“A cucumber, watermelon, feta salad can be a delicious combination if you’re looking for a summer side for your next cookout,” says Plummer.</span>\n<h2>There are healthy drink and dessert substitutions, too.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In terms of drinks, Plummer looks to fruit again as a great way to spruce up your drinks this summer season. She suggests letting fresh fruit soak in a pitcher of water overnight for an easy fruit-infused water.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Sparkling waters are also a popular choice,” says Plummer. “They quench your thirst on a hot day while being calorie-free and sugar-free.”</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For dessert, Plummer recommends homemade frozen fruit, a yogurt pop or even a small scoop of frozen yogurt topped with fresh berries.</span>\n<h2>You can shop healthy while still minding your budget.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though making these healthy swaps sound appealing to some, they may sometimes come at a higher price. Plummer recommends shopping at your local farmer’s market for great local deals on fresh produce during the summer. She also suggests planning ahead as one of the main keys to budgeting. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Meal planning can help you stay on track with your budget while also meeting nutrition goals,” says Plummer.</span>\n<h2>Even just a few substitutions can make a huge difference.</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plummer knows nobody is expected to eat perfectly healthy foods all the time. The key, she says, is moderation. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“When you eat well, this helps you to feel your best,” says Plummer. “But if you’re enjoying a vacation or finding time to relax during the summer and want to indulge a bit, it’s perfectly OK to enjoy less healthy foods in moderation.”</span>",

    "Title": "Summer Safety Tips for Outdoor Exercise",
    "Content": "The summer sun has a way of motivating all of us to exercise. But as temperatures rise, you need to be smart about physical activity, so you can reap the rewards of outdoor exercise and stay safe in the process.\n<h2>Speak with Your Healthcare Provider</h2>\nIt’s always wise to touch base with a medical professional before increasing your level of physical activity. This is especially important if you’re older than 50, are dealing with orthopaedic issues or have a history of heart problems, stroke, diabetes or other chronic conditions.\n\n“Really, before anyone embarks on a fitness program, they should be talking to their primary care provider,” says Erica Martin, MD, a family medicine specialist and sports medicine physician with ProMedica in Toledo.\n\nYour provider is best suited to recommend the exercise plan that’s right for you.\n<h2>Get Ready and Set Before You Go</h2>\nIt’s not easy — or advisable — to jump headfirst into outdoor exercise if you’re not in good physical shape.\n\n“If someone has not exercised in quite some time, and they decide they want to embark on an exercise program in the middle of summer, they first need to establish some base level of fitness indoors, in a more climate-controlled environment,” says Dr. Martin.\n\nYou might try mall walking, for example. Or perhaps, spend time on a treadmill. Summertime heat takes a toll when you’re unaccustomed to it and can lead to serious heat-related illness. Establishing a base level of fitness makes a difference.\n\n“The fitter we are, the better we are at regulating our body temperature,” says Dr. Martin. “Sweat rate increases and heat dispensation, in general, becomes more efficient. We’re also better in tune with perceived exertion.”\n<h2>Dress for Success</h2>\nThe sun can cause sunburn, which increases your risk for skin cancer. It can also damage your eyes and cause overheating. Wear loose, lightweight clothing, and where skin is exposed, sunscreen. Dr. Martin recommends a mineral-based product with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 to 50.\n\n“The benefit of anything over SPF 50 is minimal,” she says.\n\nReapply your sunscreen according to the product label, especially if you sweat heavily or spend time in water. And for additional protection, wear a wide-brimmed hat and sunglasses that clearly state they provide UV protection.\n<h2>Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate</h2>\nYou lose water from your body when you sweat. So, staying properly hydrated — before, during and after physical activity — is critical. But don’t rely on your sense of thirst.\n\n“If you’re thirsty, you’re already a little bit dehydrated,” says Dr. Martin. The best indicator of hydration level is your urine color,” she continues. “You’re looking for urine that’s the color of light lemonade.”\n\nDr. Martin recommends drinking 8 to 16 ounces of fluid in the hours leading up to your exercise and 8 ounces 15 to 30 minutes before exercising outside. And water is best. During exercise, she recommends 13 to 27 ounces per hour.\n\n“Most people, if they’re exercising for less than an hour at a time, don’t need fancy sports drinks,” says Dr. Martin. “But if you’re exercising more than an hour, indoors or outdoors, I would encourage people to get some sort of electrolyte replacement.”\n\nShe adds that sugar-free products don’t provide the needed electrolytes.\n<h2>Know When to Go</h2>\nTry to avoid exercising in peak sun and heat, which is generally between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., according to Dr. Martin. If there are heat advisories, pollution alerts, or other things that would suggest outdoor exercise might not be safe, Dr. Martin advises to move your workout inside.\n\n“In those cases, any potential benefit that someone’s getting from exercising outdoors is probably outweighed by the potential risks,” she says.\n<h2>Recognize Heat Illness</h2>\nOf course, recognizing heat-related illness is important, too. Here are a few things to look for:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Heat cramps </strong>are a sign that your body is in distress. Get to a shady area, drink something cool and rest.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Heat exhaustion </strong>may cause symptoms including heavy sweating, nausea, vomiting, dizziness and headache, but no changes in mental status. With these symptoms, try to get out of the heat, remove excess clothing and put cold towels on areas that radiate heat, such as the groin and armpits.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Heat stroke</strong> is the most serious heat-related illness. Its symptoms are similar to those of heat exhaustion, but confusion is also present, and there may be little sweating even though body temperature may be 103 degrees or higher.</li>\n</ul>\n“Heat stroke is a medical emergency,” says Dr. Martin. “You need to call EMS immediately.” While you wait for help, getting out of the heat and quickly cooling down is vital.\n<h2>Have Fun</h2>\nFinally, as you exercise, focus on fun.\n\n“The most important thing with exercise is that people find what they enjoy doing and that they’re going to do routinely,” says Dr. Martin. “Just be cautious. Be smart about things and don’t try to push your body’s limits.”",

    "Title": "How a Non-diet Approach Could Help You Live Healthier",
    "Content": "“Maybe I should try keto – my friend Susie lost 25 pounds and she made it look so easy!” “I’ve heard that Paleo is the way to go!” “My sister, Lynn, dropped 10 pounds in a week and all she did was do that intermittent fasting thing!”\n\nHow many times have we been dazzled with claims/testimonials like this? Our desire for losing weight and improving our health gets quickly tied up with words like easy, fast, and low commitment, and phrases like “the pounds just melted off.” Unfortunately, time has proven over and over again that “quick and easy” typically mean “short term and not sustainable.”\n\nSo, what’s a person to do? We know excess weight is a precursor to things like diabetes, hip and knee issues, heart disease, sleep apnea and many other chronic issues. But who has time to “diet” by counting calories, weighing food, logging food, etc.?\n\nThere is a “new way of thinking” that is getting a lot of attention in the nutrition and healthy lifestyle world. It’s called by many different names, including non-diet dieting, health at any size, intuitive eating and mindful eating.” The bottom line is that it doesn’t promise quick fixes or easy plans, but it does take into consideration your whole body, not just how many calories you are eating.\n\nSo what are the basic principles of this “new way of thinking”? Here are some key points:\n<h2>1. This is not a diet.</h2>\nDieting typically equals restriction in our minds. And if you think about what happens when someone tells you you can’t have something or you can’t do something, most of us dig in harder and find a way. So no food is off limits but there is more thought put into why you are choosing the food you are choosing and whether or not that particular food will help you feel your best.\n<h2>2. Getting in tune with your body is key.</h2>\nWhen we are young, we intuitively know when we are hungry or full. As we get older there are several factors that influence how much we eat. How much food we are offered, servings at restaurants, seeing other people eat, social media and having to finish our plate before we can go outside and play are just a few of the “messages” we get about our hunger levels. It’s vital to our non-diet approach that we get in tune with what our bodies are asking for. You might be surprised just how simple portion sizes can be when you pay closer attention to how much food your body is requesting.\n<h2>3. Challenge the “moral labels” we put on food.</h2>\nWords like good, bad, empty, and junk have all of us equating that to our own value as a person, on some level. Craving a cookie or enjoying a piece of birthday cake does not make you a bad person, but on some level if we are “dieting” we feel shame and guilt for enjoying these foods.\n<h2>4. Find new ways to cope with life’s ups and downs.</h2>\nFood equals comfort for a lot of people. A pretty universal example is getting a sucker or a cookie if you are hurt emotionally or physically as a child. We learn as a young child that we can “self soothe” by eating something sweet. There are a lot of other ways to improve our coping skills, such as meditation, talking with someone, listening to music or doing some sort of physical exercise.\n<h2>5. Reframe our thinking about physical movement.</h2>\nMany people see exercise as torture or something that takes up too much time. If we re-shift our thinking to think about physical movement as something beneficial for our body; not just for consideration with weight, but for circulation, flexibility, balance, clearer thinking and increased energy, then we take the focus off of the difficulty or discomfort. Movement is much more enjoyable to think about than the mental images sweating on the treadmill for an hour conjures up. Exploring the local park, playing with your kids/grandkids or enjoying the sunshine while paddling in a canoe sounds much more like fun than exercise.\n\nLike anything in life worth doing, shifting your thinking to a more non-diet approach takes practice and effort. Our bodies are wonderful, intuitive beings if we give ourselves the opportunity to listen and appreciate all that our bodies can do.\n\nIf this non-diet approach sounds like something you would like to learn more about, ProMedica offers nutrition counseling at the Diabetes and Nutrition Center for those with a provider referral.",

    "Title": "DASH Your Way to a Healthier Heart",
    "Content": "Did you know that hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a major risk factor for heart disease? According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/facts.htm\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC), almost half of all adults in the United States have hypertension, and only 24% of those adults have their condition under control.\n\nEvery February we are reminded of the importance of taking care of our heart during American Heart Month. If you have hypertension, or think you may be at risk, make sure to talk with your doctor about what you can be doing to keep your blood pressure in a healthy range. One key area to focus on when working to treat or even prevent hypertension is eating heart healthy foods.\n<h2>DASH Basics</h2>\nThe Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is one of the best-researched eating patterns to help prevent and manage heart disease. Think of DASH as less of a diet, and more of a heart-healthy way to eat for the long term!\n\nThe DASH eating plan focuses on increasing healthy foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy, beans, and nuts. The eating plan is often combined with reduced sodium intake (&lt;2,300mg sodium per day for most individuals) for optimal heart health. The combination of foods high in potassium, magnesium, calcium, and fiber in the DASH plan, paired with reduced sodium, can help to lower high blood pressure and keep your heart healthy. Research has also found that following a DASH eating plan can help reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol, which is another perk for keeping our hearts healthy!\n\nA few things that are limited in the DASH plan include high fat meats, high fat dairy, and foods and beverages high in sugar. For more information about getting starting with DASH, visit the <a href=\"https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/dash-eating-plan\">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s resource page</a>.\n<h2>Recipes to Focus on Heart Health</h2>\nEating healthy and following DASH does not need to be expensive. Beans, both dried and canned, can be a great, low-cost food to add into your day as part of the plan. They are rich in protein, fiber, and potassium, which makes them a great choice for keeping your heart healthy. When choosing canned beans, make sure to choose “no salt added” or “low sodium” options when available, or drain and rinse regular canned beans to reduce the sodium content.\n\nTo get started adding more beans into your routine, try a black bean burger in place of a regular burger, black bean salsa as a delicious snack, or black bean brownies as a fun way to sneak beans into a sweet treat that’s better for your heart.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8013 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Black-Bean-Burgers-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n<h3>Black Bean Burger</h3>\n<a href=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/wellness/black-bean-burgers/\">View Recipe</a>\n\n[/column]\n\n[column md=\"4\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8015 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Black-Bean-Brownies-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n<h3>Black Bean Brownies</h3>\n<a href=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/wellness/black-bean-burgers/\">View Recipe</a>\n\n[/column]\n\n[column md=\"4\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8017 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Black-Bean-Salsa-300x199.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"199\" />\n<h3>Black Bean Salsa</h3>\n<a href=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/wellness/black-bean-salsa/\">View Recipe</a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n<em>Chloe Plummer, MS, RD, LD, is a clinical dietitian at the ProMedica Food Clinic.

Pick over 1 pound dry beans to remove any pebbles or broken beans and rinse well under cold water. Place in a large bowl, cover with 3 inches of cold water and soak for 4 to 24 hours.  2. When you’re ready to cook the beans, heat 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add 1 small chopped onion, 2 to 3 chopped garlic cloves and 1 chopped celery stalk (optional). Cook, stirring, until the vegetables are beginning to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Drain the beans and add to the pan. Add enough cold water to cover the beans by 1 inch. Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes. Lower the heat to a bare simmer, partially cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 20 minutes to 3 hours, depending on the freshness of the beans. If at any time the liquid level drops below the beans, add 1 cup hot water. When the beans are nearly soft, stir in 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Makes about 6 cups. 3. Refrigerate beans in their cooking liquid for up to 1 week or freeze for up to 3 months. One pound dry beans makes 5 to 6 cups cooked.

    "Title": "Could Acupuncture Help You Lose Weight?",
    "Content": "If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, you know that there are many factors that can affect the number on the scale. Nutrition, movement and even sleep may make a difference in weight loss for some people. Paired with lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise, acupuncture can be used to help support healthy weight loss, too.\n<h2>How may acupuncture help with weight loss?</h2>\nAcupuncture may help with two important weight loss factors: metabolism and hormones.\n\nSome people’s digestive system and metabolism can become out of sorts and work inefficiently because of busy lives and from not eating well. Poor digestion and metabolism can cause some of us to keep on the weight and feel tired and sluggish. Our metabolism may also change as we age, making it difficult to lose extra pounds.\n\nHealthy digestion and healthy metabolism are crucial for weight management. Acupuncture may help to re-balance the digestive system so that the gut is working efficiently again. When digestion is functioning properly, it can help stimulate metabolism.\n\nHormone balance also plays a part in how some of our bodies store and process fat. When we are stressed, the hormone cortisol is released, which may change how we process fat. Daily life comes with a lot of stressors and finding ways to manage the stress could help with weight loss by lowering cortisol levels in the body.\n\nAcupuncture sessions can be very calming and relaxing for many people and cause the body to release “feel good hormones” such as endorphins, which help the body handle stress. As a person de-stresses during an acupuncture session, the body goes from the stressed “fight or flight” response into the calm “rest and digest” by stimulating the nervous system. This calm “rest and digest” response increases blood flow to the digestive system. As previously mentioned, healthy digestion is important for healthy weight.\n\nFor some women, hormone changes during menopause can make it challenging to maintain or lose weight. Research has shown that as estrogen levels decline, the amount of adipose tissue (fat) in women may increase. The decrease of estrogen makes it challenging to keep weight off. Acupuncture, along with diet and exercise, may help regulate hormone levels during menopause.\n<h2>What can I expect with acupuncture?</h2>\nAt <a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/promedica-natural-wellness-shop\">ProMedica Natural Wellness Shop</a>, acupuncture visits are customized to your individual needs and goals. That’s why a consult with a licensed acupuncturist and natural wellness practitioner is done at the first visit to discuss your needs, goals and what to expect from visits.\n\nStudies have shown that acupuncture, along with lifestyle modifications, may help decrease waist circumference. But results like this will take time and effort from both you and the acupuncture practitioner. Any possible effects from the acupuncture are cumulative, so it may take several visits to see effects. We typically suggest weekly visits for at least 3-5 weeks to jump-start the process and help a person along their weight loss journey; our licensed acupuncturist and wellness practitioner will discuss an approach to help support your needs and goals during your initial consultation.\n\nLearn more about the basics of acupuncture in this video:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5_lQ1Z04MoQ\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "How to Stock Your Pantry for a Pandemic",
    "Content": "During normal times, grocery shopping can be a challenge. A pandemic, as no doubt all of us are learning, can take it to an entirely new level of frustration. What should we buy when our usual items are scarce? Below are some suggestions for stocking a “pandemic pantry.”\n<h2>Fruits and Vegetables</h2>\nPandemic or no pandemic, fruits and vegetables are “a must” for keeping your immune system in top shape. In order to extend the shelf life of vegetables, consider buying them frozen without seasonings or sauces. For canned vegetables, choose ”no salt added” or  “low sodium” if available; if not, consider soaking your canned vegetables in water for 30 minutes before cooking or, at the very least, rinsing them off before cooking.\n\nFor fruits, look for varieties canned in “juice from concentrate” or water. Try to avoid fruits canned in syrup—heavy or light. Can’t stand canned or frozen fruits and vegetables but want to limit visits to the grocery store? Fresh apples, potatoes, winter squash, onions, carrots and celery tend to have a longer shelf life.\n<h2>Protein</h2>\nProtein is essential for recovery after illness and repairing damaged tissue or muscle. Skinless chicken breasts, lean cuts of beef (look for the word “loin” or “round” in the cut), ground turkey and fish are great options and can be frozen for later use. Good canned options include low-sodium (if available) tuna, salmon or chicken. Don’t forget about non-meat proteins, such as unsalted nuts (all kinds), unsalted seeds (all kinds), nut butters, legumes (canned or dried), low-fat/low-sugar Greek yogurt, cottage cheese or eggs. Even tofu can be frozen!\n<h2>Grains</h2>\nAn important staple, grains are a nutritional powerhouse and can be used to stretch meals over several days. Even better, they can be bought in bulk for cheap and have an insanely long shelf life when stored properly. Brown rice and whole-grain pasta are great choices and readily available, but why not take this time to experiment with an unfamiliar grain? Farro, quinoa (pronounced “keen-wa”), freekeh, barley and bulger are just a few of the many you might find on a grocery shelf these days; you might also notice bean-based pastas, which use dried legumes in place of wheat and tend to be higher in fiber and protein. Even better, these “specialty” products may be more available in a pandemic, as more familiar grains such as rice get snapped up quickly.\n\nDon’t forget about oats (buy plain in bulk) and, of course, whole-grain bread, which can be frozen. If traditional bread is a scarce item, English muffins, pita bread and even plain rice cakes are good substitutes for toast and sandwiches.\n<h2>Dairy and Dairy Alternative</h2>\nFor Americans, dairy is a major source of calcium, which is key in muscle function and healthy bones. Milk is also one of the few dietary sources of Vitamin D, which we normally get from sunshine. Being under quarantine orders can severely limit the time we spend in the sun! Although children under age 2 may need whole milk, adults should choose 1% or skim milk to limit saturated fat intake. Dairy milk can certainly be frozen, but there are several shelf-stable non-dairy milks such as almond milk, rice milk, cashew milk and coconut milk. Be sure to go for plain, non-sugared varieties.\n<h2>Miscellaneous Staples</h2>\nTo round out your pandemic pantry, keep dried herbs and spices on hand, which have a long shelf life. Broths (chicken, beef, vegetable, etc.) are a handy ingredient to have for soups, stews and casseroles, as are pasta sauces. Of course, don’t forget about healthy cooking oils such as olive or canola.\n\nBuying groceries and preparing meals can be especially challenging during a pandemic. Go easy on yourself and use this time to explore some new options that may just become part of your meal rotation.\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">View More Coronavirus Updates and Resources</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/COVID-19.aspx\"] Go to Resource Center [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "How to Combat Stress Eating",
    "Content": "When we don’t manage our stress well, it can lead to issues with our health, including an expanded waistline. There are biological and emotional reasons why we reach for food when we’re stressed. Understanding how stress affects our bodies, and our eating, is the best way to combat stress eating. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/david-knieriem-md-family-medicine\">David Knieriem, MD</a><a title=\"David Knieriem, MD\" href=\"http://www.promedica.org/body.cfm?id=17&amp;action=detail&amp;ref=2563\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">,</a> a family medicine doctor with ProMedica Physicians, answers some basic questions regarding stress eating.\n<h2>Why does stress make me eat?</h2>\nEating is the body’s natural reaction to stress. In prehistoric times, dangerous situations – such as an encounter with a wild animal – would trigger a human’s “fight or flight” response. This would release two hormones: adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nAdrenaline allows your body to get more oxygen to the lungs, increasing physical performance for short bursts of time. Once the stress of the danger passes, cortisol is released, increasing your appetite and fatigue.\n\nToday, our body works the same, but the stress factors have changed. Although you aren’t fending off or fleeing from wild animals, an argument or stressful phone call still creates the same “fight or flight” response. When the stressful situation has passed, increased cortisol makes you hungry, even if you haven’t used much energy.\n\nThe foods we crave while stressed often include carbohydrates and sugars, which provide quick energy. Unfortunately, this can lead to unhealthy choices such as chips and sweets, which can eventually mean weight gain or obesity.\n<h2>How else does stress affect my body?</h2>\nStress is your body’s natural reaction to high-pressure situations. Experiencing stress for a long period of time can have a negative impact on your health. In addition to weight gain, stress can lead to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>High blood pressure</li>\n \t<li>High heart rate</li>\n \t<li>Changes in metabolism</li>\n \t<li>Changes in blood flow to your muscles</li>\n \t<li>Insomnia</li>\n \t<li>Headaches</li>\n \t<li>Backaches</li>\n \t<li>Digestion problems, such as diarrhea or constipation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How can I stop stress eating?</h2>\nHelping your body relax will help stop your body’s response to stress, and will ultimately curb your stress eating. Try to identify stressful situations and avoid them when possible.\n\nSometimes, stress can’t be avoided. Job worries, financial problems, busy schedules, and other commitments can contribute to rising stress. People may also experience stress internally, when they are not living up to their own expectations related to values, goals and self-image.\n\nHere are some tips for managing stress:\n<h3>Breathe.</h3>\nMaking an effort to breathe in a slow and gentle pattern can calm the automatic nervous system and make you feel more relaxed.<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/general-health/5-minute-meditation-for-beginners/\">Try our 5-minute meditation for beginners.</a>\n<h3>Sleep.</h3>\nGetting at least six to eight hours of sleep each night helps refresh and relax your body. <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/general-health/10-ways-to-get-a-better-nights-sleep/\">Here are 10 ways to get a better night's sleep.</a>\n<h3>Exercise.</h3>\nPhysical activity can boost your endorphins, clear your mind and improve sleep.\n<h3>Eat nutritious foods.</h3>\nSugary and fatty foods deplete your body of nutrients and can affect your mood negatively. Reach for a healthy alternative, such as crunchy carrots to relieve tension or a banana to satisfy your sweet tooth. <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/wellness-articles/recipes/#posts\">Click here for healthy recipes.</a>\n<h3>Find support.</h3>\nSurround yourself with supportive people who can help you with the stressful situations you are experiencing.\n<h3>Avoid nicotine; use caffeine and alcohol in moderation.</h3>\nThese substances may make you feel better initially, but their effects can make you feel worse and lead to long-term health problems.\n\nManaging stress can be difficult. Finding ways to reduce and manage stress can help you take charge of your stress and your eating. If you’re experiencing chronic stress, talk with your primary care physician.",

    "Title": "5 Tips to Reduce Sodium in Your Diet Immediately",
    "Content": "You may have heard it all from your doctor already—cut back on the sodium in your diet and your blood pressure will improve! Many people are already aware that a diet high in sodium can worsen high blood pressure. Dietary sodium has also been linked to other poor health outcomes, such as compromised bone health and increased risk of fracture as we age, and earlier onset of dementia. Additionally, one recent study found that in 2017 alone, a high intake of sodium was single-handedly responsible for three million deaths worldwide.\n\nAny of these factors is reason enough to cut back on sodium. However, one need only glance at a random nutrition label on a canned or boxed good to be shocked into reality: Sodium is <em>everywhere! </em>Adding up milligrams in your head can be a daunting task. Fortunately, there are a few simple lifestyle changes that guarantee you’ll eat less sodium (and require minimal checking of nutrition labels):\n<h3>1. Buy fresh or plain frozen vegetables.</h3>\nVegetables naturally have little to no sodium, so buying them fresh or frozen is ideal. On the other hand, <em>canned</em> vegetables can be a sodium bomb. If the fresh vegetables you buy have an unfortunate history of rotting in your vegetable crisper, opt for frozen vegetables that will last several months in your freezer (and there is no sodium added to preserve plain frozen vegetables). Steamer bags are extremely convenient—simply toss the bag of vegetables in your microwave for a hot side dish five to six minutes later. Be sure to steer clear of the frozen vegetables that contain sauces or seasoning—they will likely be loaded with sodium.\n<h3>2. Look for “Sodium Free,” “Very Low Sodium,” “Low Sodium” or “No Salt Added” on packaging.</h3>\nChances are, anything that comes in a can, box or bag has sodium in it. Big culprits are canned soups and boxed rice and pasta side dishes. When purchasing these items, look for the labels above on the front of the item. Be wary of the language food manufacturers use—“Reduced Sodium” does not necessarily mean the item is low in sodium, for example.\n<h3>3. Cook more meals at home.</h3>\nYes, this means creating more time in your schedule for cooking, which can be a challenge. There are smart ways to do this, however. For example, take 10 minutes in the mornings to throw together simple crock pot recipes, such as two chicken breasts, a can of Rotel No Salt Added Diced Tomatoes with Green Chilies and a can of Bush’s Low Sodium Black Beans. Serve over brown rice for a satisfying meal when you walk through the door that evening. When grilling meat, grill several extra pieces for use later in the week. Keep frozen veggie steamer bags handy in the freezer for easy, low-sodium side dishes. Feel your anxiety level rising at the thought of having to come up with recipes? Don’t reinvent the wheel! You can find <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/wellness-articles/recipes/#posts\">healthy recipes here</a> as well as other sites, such as <a href=\"http://www.eatingwell.com\">eatingwell.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cookinglight.com\">cookinglight.com</a> and <a href=\"http://www.diabetesfoodhub.org\">diabetesfoodhub.org</a>. Perform a search for “Low sodium” on these sites.\n<h3>4. Use herbs and spices in place of salt when cooking.</h3>\nThere are no shortage of herbs and spices in our world, and they can impart a tasty, unique flavor to your dishes. Some must-have seasonings for every kitchen include basil, black pepper, chile pepper, cinnamon, cumin, dill, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and oregano. Rosemary and paprika tend to go very well with chicken dishes, and bay leaf and dry mustard greatly enhance beef dishes. Lemon juice, lime juice and vinegar can be a great addition to many vegetables dishes.\n<h3>5. Limit eating out to once a week—including lunches.</h3>\nWhile not impossible, it can be very challenging to limit your sodium intake when eating restaurant meals (not to mention your saturated fat and calorie intake). Instead, take the leftovers from those tasty dinners you’re now cooking for lunch the next day to work. Take a few extra minutes when cleaning up after dinner to make an individual lunch or two that you can easily grab on your way out the door in the morning. Not a big fan of leftovers? Keep low-sodium frozen meals and steamer bags of veggies in the community freezer at work, or keep low-sodium whole-grain bread and low-sodium deli meat at work to make yourself a sandwich. Your body—and your wallet—will thank you.\n\nCutting sodium can seem like an enormous undertaking at first. Remember that adopting even one lifestyle change outlined above can have equally enormous—and positive—effects on your overall health.",

    "Title": "Practical Eating Tips for Weight Loss",
    "Content": "Let’s face it – losing weight is difficult. The sooner we can admit that the sooner we can get down to making the changes we all know are necessary to make. But does the end result always look the same?  I would argue that no, it doesn’t. Why is that? Because we are all, in fact, individual, which is why there is not “one way” to eat healthier. There are, however, some basics to keep in mind. So let’s get started!\n\nHere are some tips for improving your weight loss success but ultimately focusing more on improving your overall health. Because that’s the bottom line – the number on the scale is important as a tool to measure progress, but it is not the only benefit of improving our lifestyle choices.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Be more mindful with what you are eating, how much you are eating and when you are eating.</strong> If you are “hungry all of the time,” then you are probably not eating often enough. You might need some extra healthy snacks such as a piece of fruit, a bag of 100 calorie popcorn or a small handful of nuts worked into your day to prevent you from feeling hungry so often. Also, more processed foods such as chips, cookies or candy won’t stick with you as long so you tend to get hungry quicker.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Slow down!</strong> In many cases eating has become more of a race than a journey. We slam down breakfast so we can get out the door to work. We gobble up dinner so we can get the kids to practice. Our bodies aren’t designed to digest and process food at that frantic pace. Your stomach and your brain need time to communicate that there is food available and it’s time to get to work digesting it. It takes 20 minutes for that “connection” to occur and most people can eat quite a bit of food in 20 minutes!</li>\n \t<li><strong>If you are a “stress eater” we need to work on other strategies to handle stress that don’t involve food.</strong> When we are feeling vulnerable, that is not the time to try and restrict eating, but having a plan in place for what you can do instead during those “stressful times” is helpful because it reduces the “impulse eating.” If we already feel like life isn’t going our way we don’t want to cause ourselves more stress. What else CAN we do? Talk to a friend, take a walk or get some form of movement, play with your dog, cat, hamster, or whatever furry friend is available, volunteer, or read. There are many options, but having them in place prior to needing them is key.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Give yourself some time to really think about what you are willing to change.</strong> If you aren’t ready to give up dessert then start with something else like increasing vegetables daily. Incorporating healthier habits doesn’t always have to be about avoiding or eliminating. Sometimes it’s just as important to make sure we are including enough of the right things.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Incorporate more movement into your day.</strong> Walk around the grocery store perimeter once before you start your grocery shopping. Walk the dog (or your neighbor’s dog if you don’t have one). Plant a garden. Play in the yard with kids or grandkids. Invest in an exercise tape that allows you to do what is most comfortable for you.</li>\n</ul>\nTaking care of yourself involves many areas with weight management being one of them. There is never a bad time to start something that will improve your health. What one thing can you do today to get started? Give it a try – the best version of YOU is waiting!\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "How to Cut Back on Eating Sweets",
    "Content": "You know that eating extra sugar can lead to weight gain, Type 2 Diabetes, heart disease, and a whole host of health problems. Yet here you are reaching for the candy jar on your desk or accepting yet another homemade dessert from a co-worker. Before you go beating yourself up about lack of willpower, know that we are born with an innate preference for sweets. Although our preference for nutrient dense foods led to our survival as a species, nowadays our easy access to tasty, energy dense foods have led to an obesity epidemic.\n\nSo what can you do to change your behavior? Begin by taking some time to analyze why you are eating sweets and strategize a change.\n<h4>Rethink your meals</h4>\nSkipping meals, like breakfast, leaves you vulnerable to getting overly hungry and increases the likelihood of grabbing a sweet pick-me-up. Start planning ahead. Factor in enough time in your day to eat meals. After all, food is fuel and to function optimally you need to fuel-up. If time is a factor, plan some easy meals like Greek yogurt, fruit, and a handful of nuts or a slice of whole grain avocado toast, a hardboiled egg, and a fruit.\n\nYour meal choice can also affect your desire for sweets. When you eat a bowl of cereal, which is highly refined, it spikes your blood sugar and drops it an hour or two later. Then, you’re hungry and reaching for another sugar fix. Time to rethink your breakfast selection. Plan a more balanced breakfast, including three different food groups, one of them being a good protein source and another a good source of fiber. The protein and fiber will provide more staying power, so you’ll be less likely to search for a snack midmorning.\n\nYou should plan your snacks, too. If there’s a long time between meals and you have nothing to snack on but the candy jar on your desk or the vending machine down the hall, that’s what you’ll be eating. Get rid of the candy jar – out of sight out of mind! Start bringing in healthier snacks. Plan snacks that have staying power such as a handful of nuts, fresh fruit, a sandwich bag of fresh vegetables, Greek yogurt, or a hardboiled egg.\n<h4>Brush up on your sugar knowledge</h4>\nIf you have a hard time cutting back on the sweets, another thing to sharpen up is your nutrition IQ and the sugar content in foods. Over the years, food manufactures have added more and more sugar to our food supply. Just to be clear, I am not talking about the sugar that occurs naturally in fruit, milk, sweet potatoes, and carrots. The sugar in these foods are paired with vitamins, minerals, and often fiber; healthy nutrients that we need. These <em>unprocessed</em> foods take longer to digest, have a more blunted rise to our blood sugars, and are more likely to make us feel full.\n\nObviously, there is a lot of added sugar in pop, candy, and cookies, but when you look at food labels you’ll notice the added sugar in other items, such as spaghetti sauce, granola bars, salad dressings, yogurt, and prepared meals. The newly revised food labels not only tell us how much sugar is in that food, but how much of that sugar is added as opposed to occurring naturally. It may be helpful to visualize that four grams of sugar equals one teaspoon of sugar. Seeing that a bottle of sweet tea has 48 grams of sugar or 12 teaspoons of sugar may inspire you to quit sugar sweetened drinks cold turkey. The American Heart Association advises women and children to limit added sugar to 6 teaspoons or 25 grams of sugar a day, whereas men should limit their sugar intake to 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar per day.\n\nGive yourself some time as you start to reduce sugar in your diet; change doesn’t happen overnight. You will find that you are more successful working on one aspect of your eating pattern at a time, like eating healthier snacks rather than trying to change everything overnight. As you grow accustomed to eating less processed foods, you will probably find those sugary foods lose their appeal.\n\n<em>Deborah Karl, LD, RD, CDE, is the program coordinator at the ProMedica Diabetes Care Center.</em>",

    "Title": "Enjoying the Holidays With an Eating Disorder",
    "Content": "Oftentimes, people struggling with an eating disorder hear things like “If you just eat more, you’ll be fine.”  Or “Why can’t you just eat? You’d feel so much better.”  Unfortunately, it’s not that easy. The holidays present an even bigger challenge to work toward balanced meals while maintaining a healthy emotional outlook on food. All while seemingly everyone else cooks, bakes and eats their way through the next few months. The “holidays” start at Halloween and continue through New Year’s. When someone is dealing with an eating disorder their anxiety surrounding the holidays starts much earlier.\n\nHere are some things to consider when you are examining how the holiday “food frenzy” might be causing distress for someone with an eating disorder:\n<ul>\n \t<li>There are MANY more events related to food at this time of the year. Family parties, work events, advertisements for festive community events, and many, if not all of them, offer food.</li>\n \t<li>Much of the “food” offered at these events are foods that cause distress for people with an eating disorder. Consider the increase in “sweet treats” and higher calorie/higher fat appetizers and “once a year foods” such as stuffing or pecan pie that is readily available.</li>\n \t<li>There is a great deal of “socializing” that involves food and drink choices. Someone with an eating disorder may feel “judged” if they don’t take part in the food offered.</li>\n \t<li>These holidays are happening at a time when it’s already darker and colder which can contribute to seasonal depression and heighten eating disorder symptoms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Helpful Tips</h4>\nSo how can we all enjoy the holidays a little more? Here are some tips for the person with the eating disorder as well as for those that love and care about someone with an eating disorder.\n\nLet’s start with the individual with the eating disorder first:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Be honest about how you are feeling.</strong> Share with a close friend or support person what you are concerned about.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Try not to overbook yourself.</strong> You aren’t obligated to attend every event you are invited to.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Make new holiday traditions that work better for you</strong> at this stage in your recovery/treatment. Consider coffee with the family later in the day instead of the full meal so you can stay on track with your meals without increasing your stress/anxiety.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Ask someone you trust to accompany you</strong> to whatever event you are attending. Tell them ahead of time what your concerns are about the event and plan a strategy to keep yourself on track.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stick as closely to your treatment plan as possible.</strong> Getting the proper nutrition is vital to keeping your health maximized when you are facing an increase in your stress levels.</li>\n</ul>\nFor the person supporting someone with the eating disorder:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Be patient.</strong> Sometimes just being there as a friendly face is enough. You don’t have to “police the food” to be helpful.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Talk about a strategy</strong> for approaching the new foods at the event ahead of time. Have a plan in place for how long you will be staying at the event.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Help the individual focus on the non-food aspects</strong> of the holidays. Talk about the decorations, the music, etc. and try not to only talk about what the person is or isn’t eating.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Have an exit strategy in place</strong>. If the anxiety gets too high, then leaving might be the best option. Give a lot of support and encouragement to them for going to the event and spending whatever time was spent.</li>\n</ul>\nKeep in mind, eating disorder recovery is a long process. Controlling what is eaten, when it’s eaten and how much is eaten is a very central part of developing an eating disorder. Being surrounded by a lot of food all at once as well as an increased number of people and noise can be overwhelming.  Help your loved one remember why the holidays can be fun and focus on time spent together with or without food.\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "Tight Muscles? Myofascial Release May Help",
    "Content": "Our bodies were made to move. Tightness in our muscles can lead to restricted movement, discomfort and injury. A type of therapy called myofascial release can be beneficial in loosening the band of tissue that wraps around muscle fibers, aiding in healthy mobility.\n\n“Myofascial release is a soft tissue therapy for releasing tension in the fascia that restricts movement in our bodies,” explains Ann Heckler, certified trainer, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-foreverfit\">ProMedica ForeverFit</a><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/forever-fit/pages/default.aspx\">.</a> “Our myofascial release class utilizes techniques like compression and shearing to help muscle and tissue relax and lengthen.”\n\nWords like “compression” and “shearing” may sound painful, but the techniques should not be painful. Participants are in full control of the guided technique throughout the class.\n\n“The self-massage tools we use in class focus on deep pressure points throughout the body,” says Heckler. “Participants are guided to work to a tolerable point and each person is in control of how much pressure they use and the intensity of the release.”\n\nPeople who practice myofascial release may see the following benefits:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Better stretching: </strong>Myofascial release stimulates and opens your muscles, making your stretching more effective.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Joint alignment: </strong>An upright and aligned body is a great home to live in! Plus, it helps your body handle the stresses of gravity. Those with joint issues may see an increase in their range of motion.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Reduced soreness: </strong>Rolling out your muscles clears out the after-effects of exercise by pumping nutrition into the muscles and moving waste products out. This helps reduce soreness in the muscle.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Reduced risk of injury: </strong>Just as your tires wear unevenly if your car’s alignment is off, your ankles, knees, hips and shoulders will wear out unevenly if you aren’t properly aligned.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Loosened muscles: </strong>Myofascial release keeps your muscles loose and improves your body’s adaptability. This makes it easier for your body to respond to the demands of your lifestyle. It’s helpful for overused muscles as a result of exercise and general wear and tear on the body.</li>\n</ul>\nThe small class size offers a personalized approach so that participants can adjust to their needs.\n\n“Athletes find improvements in pre-performance as well as safe recovery, while participants who sit at a desk all day or are working with a specific area of stiffness can find more mobility and range of motion to relieve stiff joints,” says Heckler.\n\nOverall, myofascial release has preventive benefits to keep the body healthy and mobile. While the techniques may be used at home, Heckler recommends starting with a class until you have some experience practicing it or seeking the guidance of a certified trainer.\n\n&nbsp;",

    "Title": "4 Ways to Keep Your Gut Healthy",
    "Content": "I don’t want to alarm anyone, but your digestive tract is teeming with bugs. Trillions upon trillions of them.\n\nBut don’t panic — these bugs (or microbes) are good for you, and are supposed to be there! You already may be vaguely aware that microbes play a role in digestion, but that’s not all they do. Microbes have a hand in immunity, vitamin creation and even weight.\n<h4>What is microbiota, and what does it do?</h4>\nOur bodies play landlord to thousands of kinds of bacteria, virus, archaea and fungi, which together are called the microbiota. Your individual microbiota contains 10 – 100 trillion microbes. (For comparison, if all the microbes squatting inside you were evicted all at once, you’d immediately lose 10 pounds. But don’t try that at home.)\n\nBelieve it or not, your microbiota directs many body functions including digestion, immunity, mood and cognition, so much so that some scientists consider it to be an essential organ. For example, microbiota can greatly increase the number of metabolic tools of the human gut, which can allow you to squeeze more energy (in other words, calories) from foods than your digestive system could on its own. Back in the time of our ancestors, this was a good thing: They didn’t always know when their next meal was coming, so reaping as many calories from their food as possible and storing those calories as fat ensured they survived a possible famine.\n<h4>Microbiota and Our Weight</h4>\nThis will surprise no one: Being able to harvest excessive calories from food doesn’t work out so well in our modern world, where high-calorie tasty food lurks around every corner. Although the cause of obesity is very complex, the role of microbiota is being intensely studied. Interestingly, some studies suggest that the microbiota of folks who struggle with weight is able to pull calories more efficiently from food and store those calories as fat. Conversely, the microbiota of folks who can eat whatever they want and never gain an ounce (we all know at least one) simply are not able to do so.\n\nWhat kind of microbes take up residence in your gut is heavily influenced by what you eat, where you live, your health status, age, gender, ethnicity, stress level and even the types of medications you take. Some of these things, like gender, age and ethnicity, we have little control over. However, we do have a lot of control over one important factor: What we eat.\n<h4>All right then—what should I eat?</h4>\nNow we’re getting to the good stuff. What can we do to attract the most beneficial microbes?\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Eat. More. Fiber.</strong> Beneficial microbes love, love, love fiber. Eating a plant-based diet is the best way to increase your fiber intake. Try incorporating a meat-free day into your week; halve the amount of meat in recipes and double the veggies; snack on whole fruit, vegetables and nuts; and, if nothing else, start throwing legumes into your dishes. Black beans, garbanzo beans, pinto beans, etc., are easy to add to salads, soups and casseroles, and are tasty as a side dish. A word of warning: Increase your fiber intake slowly, adding a few grams a day, and drink a lot of water. Doing it too quickly or without enough water can lead to stomach issues.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat less saturated fat.</strong> The kind of microbes that can reap more calories from your food thrive in a high-fat environment. Swap out that butter on your toast for peanut butter; use olive oil, an unsaturated fat, for sautéing foods; and experiment with avocado or mustard in place of mayonnaise as a sandwich spread.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat fewer refined carbohydrates, added sugars and processed foods.</strong> The more steps there are between the original food and the food you actually eat, the more processed that food is. Think about processed foods this way: You can walk out to an apple tree right now, pluck a shiny apple off the tree and enjoy a juicy bite. Nothing needs to be done to the apple to get it to an edible form. However, you can’t walk out to an apple tree and pluck a jar of applesauce off the tree. Many things have to be done to apples to get them into applesauce form. Processed foods also tend to have more added sugars. Not-so-friendly microbes thrive on this diet.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Enjoy fermented foods like kefir, farmer’s cheese, kombucha, kimchee and low/non-fat, sugar-free yogurts.</strong> These foods actually contain beneficial microbes themselves, so when you eat them, you populate your gut with them. Of course, to support their continued existence, you’d have to make the all the previously mentioned changes to your diet.</li>\n</ol>\nIt’s certainly not easy to make changes to your diet, but small steps in the right direction are worth it. Your gut bugs will thank you! And, you’ll thank your gut for your strengthened immunity and body function.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/contributors/tara-farley-rdn-csowm-cde/\">Tara Farley, RDN, CSOWM, CDE,</a> is a dietitian with ProMedica's digestive healthcare team. </em>",

    "Title": "Should Your Doctor Know What You Eat?",
    "Content": "Many people bring in a list of medications to their doctor visits to make sure that their doctor has up-to-date information about the various treatments they may be receiving. This helps the doctor get a more complete look at a patient’s health.\n\nBut what about what you eat? Is that important for your doctor to know? Do they care if you take supplements or a multi-vitamin with vitamin C? Do they need to know if you are vegetarian? The answer is a resounding YES!\n\nJust like medications, dietary habits and preferences can affect your health. There are several reasons why it’s important to share with your doctor everything that is going into your body. Here are just a few examples:\n<ul>\n \t<li>A combination of a certain supplement and a prescription medication may not be the best for you. Some combinations of supplements and prescriptions may actually worsen side effects.</li>\n \t<li>Diet changes such as cutting back on calories may mean that you need a smaller dose of medication, particularly if the reduction in calories has caused any weight loss.</li>\n \t<li>Talking about what you are eating lets your doctor know what your goals are. For example, if you are trying to lower the salt in your meal plan and you have high blood pressure, your doctor will be able to monitor your blood pressure with more accurate information since they know you already took the initiative to make some dietary changes.</li>\n \t<li>Having an open conversation about what dietary changes you are making allows for a more productive conversation with your physician about what you are willing to do and how they can help. A lot of people are afraid to talk about their weight with their doctor for fear of judgement, but you are there to receive total care. The reality of what obstacles you are facing gives your physician an opportunity to offer additional strategies to help you reach your goals.</li>\n \t<li>There may be certain types of restrictive meal plans that are not appropriate given your medical history.</li>\n \t<li>There may be resources in the area that you aren’t aware of that will help you make the dietary changes you are trying to achieve.</li>\n \t<li>Based on your lab work, some meal plan changes may not be right for you and talking with your physician about them will help get you on the right track.</li>\n</ul>\nYour health is important, not only to you but to your whole health care team. The medication list, dietary changes and supplements are all pieces of the puzzle. Talking about your diet with your healthcare team gives everyone a much more complete picture of your goals and how you are working to achieve them. Even with today’s technology, it’s important that you be your own best advocate, and share information with your doctor that will help with prevention and proper care.\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "3 Great Moves To Strengthen Your Back",
    "Content": "Back pain is a common problem among Americans. In fact, low back pain is the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading contributor to missed work days, according to the <a href=\"https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/Patient-Caregiver-Education/Fact-Sheets/Low-Back-Pain-Fact-Sheet\">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.</a>\n\nAnn Heckler, fitness instructor at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-foreverfit\">ProMedica ForeverFit,</a> says that our lower back often gets attention because it’s prone to injury. It takes on more of a load, whether we’re picking something up or just sitting a long time. But the upper back can be weak or injured, too, contributing to an aching back and neck, bad posture, slouching, and tension.\n\nPosture may play a big part. If the spine has been injured or simply strained, poor posture can worsen ongoing back discomfort and pain. \"Avoiding poor posture and cultivating good structural alignment of the spine in general is key to alleviating back pain,\" explains Heckler. \"Proper postural alignment is basically having your ears over the center of your shoulders and your shoulders squared over your hips. Once you create this good posture, your pain might be alleviated. If not, it is possible that the discs in your spine need to be cared for by a doctor.\"\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/GoodPosture.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7442 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/GoodPosture-e1551296972161.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3528\" height=\"2832\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\nAs part of your core, strengthening your back is fundamental to giving your body the support it needs. “Everything in the body is related; if one part’s off, the other part’s off,” says Heckler. “If one part of your back is tight, it’s going to affect the rest of your body.”\n\nWhile back strengthening is important for injury prevention, you don’t necessarily need to shy away from it if you’ve already injured your back. However, you will want to take certain precautions.\n\n“Talk with your doctor before trying to strengthen your back, especially if you have an injury,” recommends Heckler. “If you have an existing injury, such as a bulging disc, it could make it a lot worse.”\n\nOnce your doctor gives you the green light, Heckler recommends sticking with therapeutic, mild back bends if you have a back condition or injury. Pain isn’t always a good indicator of whether or not you’re overdoing it. If you’re really mobile, certain stretches or movements may even feel good but could be damaging for your back.\n\n“Go into back work mindfully, slowly and using your breath. If you find yourself holding your breath, you’ll want to come out of the movement so you aren’t bending or stretching as deeply,\" advises Heckler.\n\nIf you're looking to stretch and strengthen your back, Heckler recommends the following three movements:\n<h4>Cat Cow</h4>\nThis movement is one of Heckler’s “go to” moves to start her yoga classes. It gets blood flowing to warm up the spine and is also good for balance, flexibility and strength. The movement of tucking in the tailbone and then extending it back can also help you determine where your pelvis should be aligned when neutral, such as when you’re sitting or standing. This move can be done 8-10 times or fewer if you're feeling fatigued.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/StrengtheningYourBack_CatCow1.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7440 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/StrengtheningYourBack_CatCow1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/StrengtheningYourBack_CatCow2.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7439 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/StrengtheningYourBack_CatCow2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h4>Prone Back Extension</h4>\nFor this movement, you can choose to lie face down on a floor mat, or to come up on all fours on the mat.

    "Title": "Curious About Pilates? 4 Facts for Beginners",
    "Content": "First introduced to the world nearly 100 years ago in New York City, Pilates is still a popular form of exercise today. Pilates classes can be found in gyms throughout the country and celebrities often sing its praises.\n\nIf you’ve never done Pilates before, you may be a little confused or even intimidated by this exercise method. But the great news is that Pilates is for everybody! Mary Arend, fitness instructor with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-foreverfit\">ProMedica ForeverFit</a>, says men, women, athletes, dancers, those with chronic pain and even pregnant mothers can enjoy Pilates.\n\n“It builds a stronger core, better balance, increases flexibility and promotes stability,” Arend explains. “Additionally, it strengthens your brain’s connections with all the micro-muscles that might get overlooked in a typical workout.”\n\nReady to learn more? Here are a few things about Pilates you may not know.\n\n<span style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17.5px; font-weight: bold;\">1. Pilates is for everyone--</span><em style=\"color: inherit; font-family: inherit; font-size: 17.5px; font-weight: bold;\">really!</em>\n\nYes, we’ve already mentioned this, but if you’re still feeling unsure if Pilates could work for you, it may help to know that the exercise method was originally developed by Joseph Pilates to help train and rehabilitate injured soldiers.\n\n“Joseph Pilates rigged springs to hospital beds to bedridden patients so they could exercise against resistance,” Arend explains.\n\nToday’s Pilates classes can be done on floor mats or a machine called the Reformer.\n<h4>2. Breathing is fundamental in Pilates.</h4>\n“Breathing helps to focus the mind and the fresh air rids the lungs of stale air,” says Arend. “The goal is to oxygenate the blood and increase overall circulation. The breath will help initiate and support movements.”\n\nIn fact, breathing is one of the six principles in Pilates: Centering, concentration, control, precision, breath and flow.\n<h4>3. Pilates strengthens your “Powerhouse”.</h4>\nThe Powerhouse consists of the transverse abdominis and rectus abdominis (abs), internal and external oblique muscles, pelvic floor muscles and erector spinae muscles.\n\n“Think of all the muscles around the buttocks all the way up to the shoulders,” explains Arend. “Having a strong Powerhouse allows for better posture and keeps the whole body connected like a tight corset around your trunk. The benefits include injury prevention, protection for your inner organs and central nervous system, potential relief from back pain, and better posture.”\n<h4>4. Pilates can strengthen weak muscles and stretch tight ones.</h4>\nAccording to Arend, Pilates is about strengthening the core, including those muscles you don’t typically think about.\n\n“We are very dominant in our anterior (front) side of the body to a point that it creates imbalance,” Arend says. “Pilates targets the back to develop overall stability and support for the spine. The specific exercises used in the method will both strengthen weak muscles and stretches the tight, creating a balance from the front to the back of your body.”",

    "Title": "3 Important Stretches for Chronic Sitters",
    "Content": "We all know that prolonged sitting takes a toll on our bodies. It can lead to stiff joints, weak muscles and an overall sedentary lifestyle that may increase your risk for disease.\n\nOur bodies were made to move! But, the reality for many of us is that we have to sit, sometimes for a long time. Ann Heckler, fitness instructor at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/wildwood-athletic-club/pages/default.aspx\">ProMedica Wildwood Athletic Club</a>, says that listening to your body is key.\n\n\"Move when you need to move,\" she says. If you're typing at a computer, stop to rotate your wrists every 15 minutes or so. Depending on your job, get up to walk when you can. How you sit is important, too. \"When you're seated at your desk, you should have your sitting bones (the bony protrusions on your bottom that touch the seat of your chair) higher than your knees.\"\n\n\"You can also firm your core while sitting,\" says Heckler. \"Try to lift the area just below your navel area up and back, as if you are pulling it into your ribs. You can perform this exercise anywhere, such as an office chair or even the car. When done regularly, it can build strength in the low abs and support for your low back.\"\n\nGood posture makes a difference, too. Sitting with your shoulders slouched and your tailbone tucked under can lead to strain and muscle weakness. Your pelvis should be in a neutral position and your shoulder blades pulled down toward your waist so your upper back muscles are engaged. This will help keep your body aligned while sitting.\n\nFor chronic sitters, Heckler recommends three types of stretching that move your spine in the various directions that it needs to move. \"Try to make time to fit these movements into your workday at least every hour, or more frequently if you feel discomfort or compression building up,\" she says.\n<h4>Flexion Extension (Seated Cat Cow)</h4>\nSimilar to a \"cat cow\" movement, this exercises helps awaken your spine and get blood moving. Round your back and tuck your tailbone under, then pull your shoulders and tailbone back to extend.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"4\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_1.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-7419 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"4\"]<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_2.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive wp-image-7420 size-full alignnone\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n\n[/row]\n<h4>Rotation</h4>\nThis rotation is a little more than just a turn or twist. Keep your hips and legs stable, then pull yourself up tall before rotating. \"A spinal twist should be like going up a spiral staircase--you'd go up and around and not just turn yourself around,\" explains Heckler. It shouldn't be a big or fast movement either. Ease into it mindfully.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"4\"] <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_3.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive wp-image-7421 size-full alignnone\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"4\"]\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h4>Lateral Flexion (Side Bends)</h4>\nSimilar with a rotation, pull yourself up tall before bending to each side. Hold each bend for about five breaths.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"4\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_4.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive wp-image-7422 size-full alignnone\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"4\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_5.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7423 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Sitting_5.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4032\" height=\"3024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n&nbsp;",

    "Title": "6 Foods That Make Your Heart Happy",
    "Content": "An overall healthy diet is important to keep your heart working properly. While no <em>one</em> food will offset the negative effects of a poor diet, certain foods are packed with vitamins and nutrients that are especially good for your heart. In fact, if your heart could smile, we think these six foods would do the trick.\n\nLearn more about each food below and try out the recipes to add these foods into your diet.\n<h4>Salmon</h4>\nThis oily fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acid, which is an essential acid that reduces inflammation in your body. It helps make blood less likely to clump and stick to the walls of the arteries and lowers your risk of blood vessel damage. Omega-3 may also lower you triglyceride levels, reduce your risk of stroke and heart disease, and lower the risk of abnormal heart beats, which may lead to sudden death.\n<h4>Almonds</h4>\nAlmonds are loaded with nutrients such as calcium, magnesium, potassium and protein. They also help maintain good cholesterol levels and can help you raise your HDL (high density lipoprotein) or \"good cholesterol\" because they are healthy in high polyunsaturated fatty acids. If you don't care for almonds or want to mix it up, you can try hazelnuts, peanuts, pecans, pine nuts, pistachio nuts and walnuts—all have heart health benefits. Just remember to limit your portion to one serving of nuts as they can be high in calories.\n<h4>Spinach</h4>\nSpinach is rich in antioxidant vitamins and has anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce your risk for blood vessel damage and heart disease. It's also high in folate, which has been found to reduce the blood levels of homocysteine, an emerging risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plus, it's packed with vitamins A, C, and E.\n<h4>Oatmeal</h4>\nAs a whole grain food, oatmeal provides a heart healthy soluble fiber, which attracts water and turns into gel during digestion. This helps lower bad cholesterol levels because it reduces the absorption of cholesterol into your blood stream. Oatmeal is also low in fat and high in protein, making it a favorite among those who want to manage their weight, blood sugar and diabetes risk.\n<h4>Beans</h4>\nBeans are another powerhouse of soluble fiber. They are one of the best foods you can introduce or increase in your diet to protect your heart. Add them to your meals or use them in place of red meat, which is linked to a higher risk of heart disease. Different beans offer different flavors so try a variety (black, navy, white, kidney, or garbanzo) in your diet.\n<h4>Cacao</h4>\nThe multiple antioxidants and flavonoids in cacao help decrease inflammation, which make it a heart-friendly ingredient. When made into chocolate, the added sugar decreases the health benefits and nutritional value. Stick with dark chocolate that has at least 70% cacao and, if it's too bitter for your taste buds, add it to naturally sweet foods, such as fruit.",

This <a href=\"https://www.mindful.sodexo.com/mindful-meals-recipes/\">Sodexo</a> recipe is a nod to the classic but is both mindful and vegan, using a flavorful vegan demi glace, a faux \"cheese\" sauce made of carrots and potatoes, and roasted potato wedge fries. So you can enjoy a flavorful dish without feeling heavy when you're done.\n\n\"I love this plant forward dish; it's a clever take on a popular Canadian tradition,\" said Senior Executive Chef Hannah Robertson, who makes the dish in the video above. \"If you don't want to make the demi glace from scratch, you can buy it online.\"\n\nThis mindful version includes carrots and portobello mushrooms for some added nutrition, too.\n\n\"Portobello mushrooms are a good source of vitamin D, which aids in calcium and phosphorous absorption. These micronutrients play a factor in supporting bone growth,\" said ProMedica Wellness dietitian Liz Satterthwaite.\n\nIf you wanted to add in more protein, you could toss in some beans, too.\n\n\"By including beans, you can also indirectly add more fiber,\" said Satterthwaite. \"Some ideas that can make for a great addition to this meal are pinto beans, kidney beans or black beans.\"\n\nWatch Chef Robertson make this recipe in the video above.

This recipe from <a href=\"https://www.mindful.sodexo.com/mindful-meals-recipes/\">Sodexo</a> combines sweet strawberries and savory chicken, and adds crunch with pistachios and pita chip triangles. Don't like pistachios? Walnuts, almonds and pumpkin seeds also offer healthy fat and a bit of crunch.\n\nAccording to ProMedica Wellness dietitian Liz Satterthwaite, this dish is a great \"go-to\" for protein.\n\n\"Protein becomes more important the more active you are and as you age,\" explained Satterthwaite. \"Some great vegetarian protein alternatives include cubed tofu, edamame and most legumes with quinoa.\"\n\nSenior Executive Chef Hannah Robertson added, \"This is a really pretty salad. If you happen to have basil on hand, try adding in a few torn leaves. It complements the sweet and savory combination of the salad very well.\"\n\nWatch Chef Robertson make this recipe in the video above.

The Sodexo recipe brings together warm roasted potatoes, a flavorful black bean burger, baked egg whites and colorful fresh pico de gallo.\n\n\"This dish has so many great, bold flavors; it's a completely satisfying start to your day,\" said Senior Executive Chef Hannah Robertson, who is seen preparing the dish in the video above.\n\nPlus, you don't have to feel the least bit guilty about morning potatoes.\n\n\"Potatoes <em>are </em>a vegetable,\" said ProMedica dietitian Liz Satterthwaite. \"They provide many benefits and are not the cause of weight gain. They are a great source of energy, are easy to digest and contain vitamin C, A, iron and phosphorus!\"\n\nSatterthwaite said potatoes are even better when cooked in healthy fats and paired with protein and veggies. So topping this dish with an egg white and fresh pico de gallo is the way to go!\n\nThere are a few steps to this recipe, but no worries! It's not difficult to make. You can use store bought pico de gallo or even salsa if you're in a pinch.

    "Content": "My husband and I started making fruit smoothies for breakfast when I noticed that we weren’t getting in enough fruit throughout the day. This recipe is one that I developed and love to share because of its delicious flavor and balanced nutrition.\n\nPlain Greek yogurt is my favorite addition to smoothies. The Greek yogurt adds a boost of protein to the smoothie, and the fact that it’s plain yogurt means it is lower in sugar than flavored varieties. The plain yogurt gives a creamy texture to the smoothie and lets the natural sweetness of the fruit shine! Make sure to look for yogurt that has added vitamin D, since <a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/body-and-conditions/why-sunshine-is-good-for-your-health/\">many of us are low</a> in this important nutrient.\n\nSmoothies also offer a good opportunity to sneak in some vegetables, such as the spinach included in this recipe. You can try out variations of this recipe by mixing in different vegetables and swapping in other fruits to find your favorite combination.\n<h5><a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Health-Connect_Recipe_Fruit-and-Spinach-Smoothie.pdf\">Download the Fruit and Spinach Smoothie recipe.</a></h5>\nFruit smoothies make for a fun and delicious treat; whip one up as a snack or enjoy as part of a healthy meal!\n\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Chloe_Garden-Grocer_HeadShot_IMG_2843.jpg\"><img class=\" size-full wp-image-1075 alignleft\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Chloe_Garden-Grocer_HeadShot_IMG_2843.jpg\" alt=\"Chloe_Garden Grocer_HeadShot_IMG_2843\" width=\"221\" height=\"147\" /></a><i></i>\n\n<i><a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/contributors/chloe-berdan/\">Chloe Plummer, MS, RD, LD,</a> is a clinical dietitian with ProMedica Advocacy and Community Health, and her main passion is promoting childhood and adolescent health and wellness.

Perhaps it isn’t to save some moolah, but rather to lower your intake of saturated fat and increase your intake of vegetables and fiber. Or maybe you have a really picky eater who won’t touch meat and are concerned with making sure they are getting in enough protein.\n\nIf any of these scenarios are true for you then these three meatless recipes are right up your alley: Family friendly, high protein, healthy, and not too scary.
