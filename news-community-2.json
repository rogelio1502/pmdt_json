    "Title": "Music Therapy Helps Normalize the Hospital Experience",
    "Content": "<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BxJEgcTRojA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nTaylor Wilson, MT-BC, loves sharing her passion with music, especially with the children at ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital. As a music therapist with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/child-life\">Child Life,</a> she visits the various pediatric units and provides music therapy to patients and their families.\n\nThe many benefits of music therapy may not always be obvious, but there's a lot going on behind every note.\n\n\"It might look like we're just singing songs, but we're also working on communication. We're also working on elevating mood,\" Wilson explains. \"Sometimes, we work on pain management by learning how to do deep breathing and relaxation techniques. Sometimes it's just distraction because it's kind of isolating in their room. So I'm bringing them out of their shell a little bit.\"\n<h2>The Child Life Program</h2>\nThe Child Life program exists to help patients and families cope with the emotional impact of acute and chronic illness, injury, trauma, disability, loss, and bereavement. Clinically trained Child Life Specialists provide evidence-based, developmentally, and psychologically appropriate interventions. In addition to music therapy, the Child Life program offers advocacy, pet therapy, medical play, therapeutic play, bead programs, educational services and sibling support.\n\nMaria Gaskins, MHRM, Supervisor, Child Life, adds: “The Child Life staff and volunteers at Ebeid Children’s Hospital create opportunities for children to feel like themselves while in the hospital. They are often a friendly face that plays games, creates art, or reads books with the patients.”\n\nThese moments also offer respite for parents and caregivers so they may grab a meal or take care of personal business outside of the room and feel comfortable leaving their child with the Child Life staff member to do something fun and therapeutic.\n<h2>Music with a Lasting Impact</h2>\nIt doesn’t take long for the children to warm up to the Child Life team. At the start of music therapy, children are often amazed and curious with Wilson’s instruments, but then they slowly inch their way into participating.\n\n“I sing some familiar songs and they’re right there with me. Usually they’re singing right along,” she says. “Sometimes we do songwriting because it's a way that they can control something. They can't control a lot of things, but they can control what instruments they're playing, what songs they're talking about and things like that.”\n\nExperiences like these help to normalize the hospital experience by reducing the stress and anxiety associated with being in a hospital.\n\n“By creating ways for patients to reduce stress and anxiety, patients can begin to heal and, in some cases, reduce the length of their hospital stay,” explains Gaskins. “Child Life makes a lasting impact by creating enjoyable experiences for the patients and their families.”",

    "Content": "Joan, a resident at <a href=\"https://www.arden-courts.org/westorange\">Arden Courts – ProMedica Memory Care Community (West Orange),</a> has a love for animals, and had expressed her desire to interact with any animal that could visit her at the memory care community. Thanks to Animal Interactions from Rockland County, New York, the Arden Courts team was able to fulfill Joan’s Heart’s Desire to spend time with some animals, both big and small.\n\nSierra Mason, program service coordinator at Arden Courts, contacted Animal Interactions to help make Joan’s dream come true and bring some animals to the memory care community. “It brings me great joy to know that I can fulfill a resident’s request for something they love so much,” shared Mason.\n\nJoan was so excited about her Heart’s Desire, and to be able to share it with her husband and son. Animal Interactions brought a baby goat, two cats, a guinea pig with her two babies, two chinchillas and a rabbit with her eight babies. “The joy on Joan’s face was priceless! It was very satisfying to see the happiness the animals and everyone brought to her,” said Mason.\n\nJoan was very happy and nurturing with every animal that she got to hold. She wanted to protect them and every so often she would ask if she could take one with her or where they are going after her visit.\n\nThis was not only therapeutic for Joan, but for her family and some of the employees who were able to share in the celebration. “Seeing the smile on Joan’s face every time she got to hold one of the animals was very gratifying,” shared Martha Outz, executive director of Arden Courts. “Joan’s family felt very welcomed and they were grateful for our team helping to give their loved one hope and happiness.”\n\n<em>The Heart’s Desire program has granted thousands of our patient’s wishes since 1997. Heart’s Desire is designed to enrich the lives of our patients, residents and clients; encouraging them to take advantage of all that life has to offer and continue their active participation in the community. A Heart’s Desire can be something daring or something simple. What makes it special is that it is unique to that particular individual.</em>\n\n[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTEuanBnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJXZXN0IE9yYW5nZSBIZWFydCdzIERlc2lyZSAtIEpvYW4gKDEpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTcuanBnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJXZXN0IE9yYW5nZSBIZWFydCdzIERlc2lyZSAtIEpvYW4gKDcpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTEwLmpwZyIsInRpdGxlIjoiV2VzdCBPcmFuZ2UgSGVhcnQncyBEZXNpcmUgLSBKb2FuICgxMCkiLCJjYXB0aW9uIjoiIiwiYWx0IjoiIiwiZGVzY3JpcHRpb24iOiIifQ==,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTIuanBnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJXZXN0IE9yYW5nZSBIZWFydCdzIERlc2lyZSAtIEpvYW4gKDIpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTMuanBnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJXZXN0IE9yYW5nZSBIZWFydCdzIERlc2lyZSAtIEpvYW4gKDMpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTguanBnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJXZXN0IE9yYW5nZSBIZWFydCdzIERlc2lyZSAtIEpvYW4gKDgpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvV2VzdC1PcmFuZ2UtSGVhcnRzLURlc2lyZS1Kb2FuLTYuanBnIiwidGl0bGUiOiJXZXN0IE9yYW5nZSBIZWFydCdzIERlc2lyZSAtIEpvYW4gKDYpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=\"]",

    "Title": "Veterans Honored With Pinning Ceremony by ProMedica Hospice",
    "Content": "ProMedica Hospice Serving Southwest Michigan (Kalamazoo) recently honored the veteran patients at ProMedica Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation (Three Rivers, MI) with a pinning ceremony. The teams from both services worked together to hold this special event on Veterans Day.\n\nPinning ceremonies is a way for hospice music therapists, chaplains, veteran volunteers and volunteer coordinators to say \"thank you\" to veterans for the sacrifices they have made in serving us. America’s veterans have done everything asked of them in their mission to serve our country and we believe it is never too late to give them a hero’s welcome home.\n\nThe music therapist opened the ceremony by singing “America the Beautiful” and the hospice team continued the event by passing out flags, reading the veterans' names, and giving each veteran a pin, a star from retired U.S. flags and a certificate thanking them for their sacrifices for our country. Local elementary schools and churches also sent several cards and artwork to show their appreciation. Applebee’s in Three Rivers, Michigan, provided lunch for the veterans.\n\nKathy Shults recently retired after 35 years with ProMedica, but she still wanted to help honor the veteran patients at the center by donating handmade quilts she crafted with her daughter. The quilts were given to each veteran in attendance.\n\nKarla, a veteran resident, stated, “Having these special days thanking us for our service is a reminder that I made the right decision so many years ago.”\n\nCaleb Brooks, the senior administrator, shared, “I think if you take a moment to observe the many sacrifices our veterans have made, it is easy to understand why ProMedica, the community, health care partners and the We Honor Veterans program are so eager to serve them for a change. Having pinning ceremonies for our veterans is the least we can do as they have given so much of themselves to this country. It isn’t too much to take the time and simply say ‘thank you for your service’ to a veteran.”\n\nKen Herson, Air Force veteran and seven-year ProMedica veteran volunteer, was there to honor his fellow veterans.“In my role as a veteran volunteer, I have the privilege to honor my fellow service men and women. Each pinning ceremony is unique to the veteran and the experience they had in the military. Many ceremonies bring the veterans to tears, especially those that were not welcomed home,\" he said. \"I will always remember one pinning ceremony where a veteran had invited his four friends, all of whom served in the same era but different branches. We were able to acknowledge each of those men and honor them alongside their friend and veteran patient. The comradery flowed and they brought me into their band of brothers without missing a beat. Being a veteran volunteer with ProMedica means a lot to me. Doing something so little that means so much to not only the veteran but also the family members fills me with anticipation for the next ceremony and has enriched my retirement immensely.”\n\n[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvR2xhc3MtVmV0LmpwZWciLCJ0aXRsZSI6IkdsYXNzIFZldCIsImNhcHRpb24iOiIiLCJhbHQiOiIiLCJkZXNjcmlwdGlvbiI6IiJ9,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvcXVpbHQyLmpwZyIsInRpdGxlIjoicXVpbHQyIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvR3JlZW5WZXQtZWRpdC5qcGciLCJ0aXRsZSI6IkdyZWVuVmV0IChlZGl0KSIsImNhcHRpb24iOiIiLCJhbHQiOiIiLCJkZXNjcmlwdGlvbiI6IiJ9,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvcXVpbHQzLmpwZyIsInRpdGxlIjoicXVpbHQzIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvYXJ0d29yay5qcGciLCJ0aXRsZSI6ImFydHdvcmsiLCJjYXB0aW9uIjoiIiwiYWx0IjoiIiwiZGVzY3JpcHRpb24iOiIifQ==,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvS2xpbmdhblZldC1lZGl0LmpwZyIsInRpdGxlIjoiS2xpbmdhblZldCAoZWRpdCkiLCJjYXB0aW9uIjoiIiwiYWx0IjoiIiwiZGVzY3JpcHRpb24iOiIifQ==,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvc2hvZXNtaXRoLXZldC1lZGl0LmpwZWciLCJ0aXRsZSI6InNob2VzbWl0aCB2ZXQgKGVkaXQpIiwiY2FwdGlvbiI6IiIsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjoiIn0=,eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczpcL1wvcHJvbWVkaWNhbmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnXC9tZWRpYVwvRXdhbHRWZXQtZWRpdC5qcGciLCJ0aXRsZSI6IkV3YWx0VmV0IChlZGl0KSIsImNhcHRpb24iOiIiLCJhbHQiOiIiLCJkZXNjcmlwdGlvbiI6IiJ9\"]",

They also brought in pizza, cake and an ice cream sundae bar for Rita and her friends at the center. Rita was a dancer and loved the selection of music that was playing during her party. She also enjoyed a round of bingo and gifts from Cheryl Repko, patient care manager with ProMedica.\n\nRita stated with tears in her eyes, “I wish every day was my birthday!”\n\nKristie Carta, account liaison, stated, “Being able to put this birthday celebration together for Rita was an absolute pleasure. Rita’s smile and excitement reminded me exactly why I’m here at ProMedica Hospice. Not only do I have a passion to care for the senior population and make their last days as memorable as possible, but the team behind me is truly special as well and they will go above and beyond to make sure a patient feels loved.”\n\n[gallery link=\"file\" ids=\"eyJ1cmwiOmZhbHNlLCJ0aXRsZSI6bnVsbCwiY2FwdGlvbiI6ZmFsc2UsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjpudWxsfQ==,eyJ1cmwiOmZhbHNlLCJ0aXRsZSI6bnVsbCwiY2FwdGlvbiI6ZmFsc2UsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjpudWxsfQ==,eyJ1cmwiOmZhbHNlLCJ0aXRsZSI6bnVsbCwiY2FwdGlvbiI6ZmFsc2UsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjpudWxsfQ==,eyJ1cmwiOmZhbHNlLCJ0aXRsZSI6bnVsbCwiY2FwdGlvbiI6ZmFsc2UsImFsdCI6IiIsImRlc2NyaXB0aW9uIjpudWxsfQ==\"]\n\n&nbsp;",

    "Content": "For some, working with patients with complex and severe diseases would be an incredible challenge. For Jamie Dargart, MD, MS, it’s a privilege. As a pediatric hematologist/oncologist, she treats children, adolescents and young adults with blood diseases and cancers. Dr. Dargart shares her perspective below.\n<h2>My Experience as a Pediatric Hematologist/Oncologist</h2>\n<em>\"I don't know how you do it! It must be so sad…\" </em>If I had a dollar for every time I heard this response after telling someone what I do for a living, my student loans would be paid off several times over.\n\nI am a pediatric hematology/oncology physician at ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children's Hospital. I have dedicated my professional life to caring for children with cancer, which is the No. 1 cause of death due to disease in children in the United States. And I love what I do.\n\nI understand that most people do not like to think about children developing serious and potentially life-threatening illnesses, nor do they want to dwell on the physical, mental and emotional trauma these children and their families undergo during and after treatment.\n\nBut they are <em>kids</em>. I am obviously biased as a pediatrician, but kids are simply the best. They can be loud, active, brutally honest and sticky. They can give some serious stink-eye if they are not in the mood for you to examine them, or summon the security guards after \"accidentally\" pushing the panic button at the unit clerk's desk. They dance in clinic, ride tricycles and play basketball in the hallways, stay up late playing video games, and occasionally convince me to try a jellybean that, unfortunately, really did taste like a stinkbug. With this in mind, we strive to get them back to \"normal life\" (or something that resembles that) as soon as possible – back to home, back to school and back to the activities that <em>should</em> define their childhoods.\n\nI continue to be amazed that patients and families trust me to care for them moments after meeting me, often after I have delivered devastating news. This is a privilege that I do not take lightly, and I truly am honored to be a part of their journey.",

    "Title": "My Calling: Experiences in Pediatric Critical Care Medicine",
    "Content": "For Sharon T. Thomas, MD, being a physician is more than a career, it’s a calling. As a pediatric critical care specialist, she cares for infants, children and adolescents who are severely or critically ill. Dr. Thomas shares her thoughts and experiences working at ProMedica Russell J. Ebeid Children’s Hospital in the Q&amp;A below.\n<h2>What drew you into a career in health care in the first place?</h2>\nI have wanted to be a physician since I was about 4 years old. I was interested in science and especially fascinated by how the human body works. I admired my pediatrician for his vast knowledge and compassion. I desired to be a part of this noble profession, which combines art and science to improve the human condition.\n<h2>What helped you through the pandemic?</h2>\nI am surrounded by amazing colleagues who rose to the challenges despite the uncertainties. I am so fortunate to be part of a group of dedicated physicians who are always willing to help our colleagues beyond our specialty of pediatric critical care medicine. I kept in mind that my years of education and training prepared me to be flexible and take care of people, especially during difficult circumstances. I focused on how my patients and their families depend on me to be there to care for them. Most importantly, my faith in God keeps me grounded during difficult times and my family is always cheering me on.\n<h2>What will you always remember from the past two years?</h2>\nOne of the moments from the height of the surges that stuck with me occurred toward the beginning when the hospitals were beyond capacity and we did not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE) to follow even basic protocols for the diseases we know, let alone the new one we were dealing with. As hospital staff, we knew we were potentially putting ourselves at risk to care for the patients who so desperately needed us. I was rounding on my patients and we were all wearing the same masks and gowns for days on end. I thought about my colleagues who practice in countries that are not as resource-equipped and how what we were experiencing as a shock was a daily occurrence for them.\n<h2>What inspires you to continue with your career?</h2>\nMy patients inspire me. I see being a physician as my calling. Becoming a physician takes a long time, and can be very challenging, but it is also extremely rewarding. It is an honor and a privilege to care for people when they are at their most vulnerable. I have never wanted to do anything else and continue to love my job.\n\nMy learners inspire me. I had some incredible educators and mentors in medicine, so I find it important to participate in the education and training of medical students and physicians during their residency and fellowship training.\n\nMy hope for a better future inspires me. I am also in a unique position to broaden the perception of what a physician looks like. The look on the face of a child who has never seen a doctor who looks like them is priceless. I love that I can inspire future medical doctors.",

    "Title": "Celebrating the Gift of Spanish Music",
    "Content": "<em>The following blog was written by ProMedica employee Gina Sares in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, which is celebrated this year from September 15 - October 15. The opinions expressed in this blog are solely the opinions of the author.</em>\n\nWhen I was a child, I'd fall asleep to my mom singing <em>Duérmete, Mi Niña</em>. When I got older, we listened to Buena Vista Social Club and Nat King Cole in Spanish around the house, and I sang Gloria Estefan and Selena as a teenager to practice Spanish. In college, my Latina friends taught me how to dance merengue and introduced me to Reggaeton. Now, I sing the same lullaby to my children and Spanish music is a must for baking sessions and cleaning sprees.\n\nSpanish music is just one of the ways I celebrate my heritage. Growing up in northwest Ohio, I wasn't exposed to a lot of it, but I cherished what I knew and made an effort to hear more. In honor of Hispanic Heritage Month, I'm sharing a poem that demonstrates how Spanish music helped carry me through one tough moment as a patient. It may seem simple but it made all the difference in making me feel comfortable during a vulnerable time.\n\nMy Cuban and Mexican heritage is a gift from my ancestors and my community. It connects me to my past, inspires my future and strengthens me in the midst of challenges – even in an MRI machine.\n\n<strong>MR Lumbar Spine</strong>\n\nI'm probably the tech's first patient\nto ask for Reggaeton in the MRI machine.\nHe asks me how to spell it before\nwheeling me into the tunnel.\n<em>Reggae. Ton.?\n</em><em>Yep. Reggae. Ton.</em>\n\nThen it's a white washcloth over my eyes,\na stiff pillow below my knees,\nmy heart thumping wildly.\n\nI try to find a happy place,\nwhere my skin doesn't itch\nand my joints don't bend\nand I can be perfectly still\nfor 25 minutes.\n\nA happy place with answers,\nwhere pain has a name and I have a plan.\nBut the machine is so loud\nit's dizzying. It whirls around me,\ntwisting my brain.\n\nDon Omar greets me in the tunnel\nand the magnets start dancing.\n\nDUN, DA DUN. DUN, DA DUN.\n\nI breathe in the music\nuntil the rhythm tames my heart.\n\nThank God for Reggaeton.\nI needed something to cut\nthrough all of this.\nA familiar voice to shout,\n<em>¡Despiértate!\n</em><em>There's music!</em>",

It is a privilege to have a partner in providing support to cancer patients and survivors in the communities that we serve.\n\nBonnie will be going “over the edge” for the fourth year in a row this September. She shares that going over the edge was something that she was always interested in doing, and although she doesn’t like heights, she has never been scared to rappel.\n\n“The Victory Center is near and dear to my heart since it helped my own family member, my late sister, get through a very difficult time during her battle with breast cancer,” shares Bonnie. “I believe that my sister is there with me at each rappel, helping me to not be nervous and take the step over the edge.”\n\nBonnie shares that she chooses to participate in Over the Edge for Victory and other fundraising events hosted by The Victory Center to help raise money to support her patients at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-hematologyoncology-associates\">ProMedica Physicians Hematology/Oncology Associates</a>. “Everyone at The Victory Center is so kind.

    "Title": "A Reflection on Disability Allyship and Progress",
    "Content": "<em>The following blog was written by ProMedica employee Ayla Beaussejour in honor of the anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which was celebrated this year on July 26. The opinions expressed in this blog are solely the opinions of the author.</em>\n\nAs the second child of five siblings, most of my early memories revolve around my experiences in a large family. One of the realities that defined our family early on was the fact that I have a sister and brother with profound bilateral hearing loss. After pushing the pediatrician for further testing when she was not speaking at almost 2 years old, my sister was found to have profound hearing loss. My brother was born not long after, and because of my sister's diagnosis, he was tested at birth and also found to have very little natural hearing. He had hearing aids by the time he was 12 weeks old!\n\nNow as adults, they both have a cochlear implant on one side and use a hearing aid on the other. One of the first questions asked when someone hears I have deaf siblings is if I know sign language (I do not). The decision made by my parents was to pursue the \"Auditory Verbal Therapy\" route, which meant amplification with technology, and a heavy focus on speech and listening skills. My earliest memory is sitting with my older sister in ProMedica Flower Hospital's audiology waiting room while my mom and siblings attended speech therapy or saw the audiologist.\n\nReflecting on these growing-up years, I am more and more aware of the broad impact that witnessing my parents advocate for their children had on the development of what I stand for in life. I am comfortable stepping into the gap, speaking up for the voice that has been forgotten or silenced, and will always interrupt ableism when confronted with it. I have always been an ally to my siblings because they were family, but now I am proud to be an ally for the broader disability community.\n\nSeveral years ago, my sister was denied accommodations to serve jury duty. Most people do all they can to AVOID jury duty, but when she received the summons she wanted to serve. So she notified the county of her disability and requested a live captionist (someone to type out spoken words in real-time) so she could participate without fear of missing information. She advocated for weeks to be allowed to serve, and the only response she ever received was a release of duty to show up for jury selection. She was crushed to be excluded, and for me, it is situations like this that display how far we still need to go to accomplish more equitable experiences.\n\nThis year for the 32<sup>nd</sup> anniversary of the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act on July 26, I am celebrating our progress, and challenging myself and those around me to increase our awareness of how to create more inclusive and equitable spaces. Do you need to add closed captioning to your meetings? Do you need to choose a teambuilding activity that does not prioritize the able body? Do you need to confront a coworker who regularly makes a joke of mocking those with developmental disabilities?\n\nI believe that the heart of great allyship is empathy, and empathy means we are able to bring ourselves to a place where we can amplify someone else's experience to the place that it is as valuable and important as our own. Individual experience does not translate into universal understanding, but as I have grown in my allyship, I have learned that tapping into my personal history is where I have the best chance to be authentically empathetic. It is a high effort and high reward process. As we reflect and understand the impact of our individual experiences, we can then receive the gift of better understanding of different perspectives in return.\n\n<em>(Pictured L-R: Selia, Ayla, Cail, Varalyn, Trelesa, Leisha, Rich)</em>",

    "Title": "Spanish-Speaking Doctor Making an Impact in Local Latino Community",
    "Content": "You speak Spanish?!\" is a phrase of excitement that Diana Rodriguez-Salinas, MD, often hears from her patients at ProMedica Physicians Defiance and Napoleon Family Medicine locations. Dr. Rodriguez-Salinas is originally from Ecuador, grew up in Michigan and is now using her native language to improve patient experience at her practices in Defiance and Napoleon, Ohio.\n\nWhile ProMedica offers interpreter and language access services through remote translation services via an iPad, Dr. Rodriguez-Salinas shares that many patients who speak a language other than English appreciate interacting with a native speaker for both privacy concerns and cultural nuances.\n\n“One of my Spanish-speaking patients came to me and expressed her gratitude to be able to receive care not only in her native language but also from a woman provider,” Dr. Rodriguez-Salinas shared. “She said that she previously had avoided addressing some personal health issues with other providers because her son had to be present to translate.”\n\nThe number of Spanish-speaking patients at ProMedica Physicians Defiance and Napoleon Family Medicine locations has grown significantly over the past couple of months as more members of the community discover that there is a Spanish-speaking doctor at the location. Currently, Dr. Rodriguez-Salinas is serving anywhere from one to five Spanish-speaking patients a day.\n\nDr. Rodriguez-Salinas shared, “I ran into a Spanish-speaking community member who told me that she heard about me through friends and family. She said that she was very grateful that Defiance and its surrounding communities now had a Spanish-speaking provider. She said that it was a void that needed to be filled long ago.”\n\nWith the help of Dr. Rodriguez-Salinas and other providers from diverse cultural backgrounds, ProMedica is better equipped to improve the health and well-being of the diverse communities that we care for and serve.\n\n<em>To schedule an appointment with Dr. Rodriguez-Salinas or find another ProMedica provider near you, use our </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results\"><em>provider search tool</em></a><em>, which allows you to filter results by language(s) spoken.

They do not reflect the opinions of ProMedica or other ProMedica employees.</em>\n\nAs a civilian whenever I would meet a man or woman who served our country in the military, I would say, \"thank you for your service.\" My words were well-intentioned and came from a sincere place.\n\nThis was until I met Jim. Jim was introduced to me as a Marine who served in the Korean War; more specifically, the Chosin Reservoir. I instinctively thanked Jim for his service.\n\nI was not familiar with this battle, the Chosin Reservoir. I did not remember learning about it in high school so long ago and I had never met someone who spoke about it. That night I looked up the Chosin Reservoir.  I was in tears. My tears were not because of the insane conditions these men were fighting in—and against.  My tears came from a place of embarrassment. I thanked Jim without knowing the true service and sacrifice he gave our country. At this point, my <em>thank you</em> felt empty. I had met someone who fought in one of the most savage battles in Marine Corps history. The next day, I was with Jim again and told him about my research the night before. I offered him an apology for my ignorance when I thanked him the day prior. I asked Jim if I could thank him appropriately. I explained that I had no idea of the battle he served in and thanked him for teaching me a very important lesson that I would remember when thanking Veterans in the future. We embraced and from that day began to develop a strong friendship.\n\nWhen Jim and I would meet, I learned a little more about him as a person, as a father, as a husband. I became friends with someone who served as a frontline machine gunner and a squad leader in five major battles, including the battle of the Chosin Reservoir. I learned that Jim was a recipient of several military decorations including the Purple Heart Medal for injuries he received on the battlefield. I learned about Jim's story.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nThose who served in the military have his/her own story surrounding time in service and individual sacrifices that were made. Not all stories are the same, and not every person has the same experience. The story <em>matters</em> and the individual Veteran <em>matters</em>.\n\nMy lesson: Give <strong>intention</strong> to my thank you. Before I thank an individual Veteran for his/her service, I ask questions so that I may offer an informed thank you. Some questions I ask: What branch did you serve? When did you serve? How long did you serve? What was your job while serving?\n\nNowadays, I am not thanking a Veteran…I am thanking a \"Jim\" who enlisted at age 17 and served four years (1948-1952) in the Marine Corps as a machine gunner in the battle of the Chosin Reservoir in the Korean War.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-8468 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Tracy-Roskinski-e1648828622223-264x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"264\" height=\"300\" />\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n<em>Tracy Rosinski is the Regional Veteran Liaison for ProMedica Hospice and Heartland Home Health &amp; Hospice agencies.

The opinions expressed in this blog are solely the opinions of the author. They do not reflect the opinions of ProMedica or other ProMedica employees.</em>\n\nAs August 26 rolls around, the date the Nineteenth Amendment was certified, I celebrate.\n\nI rejoice with women from every state and every cultural and religious group who have worked to secure our right to vote. The groundwork has been laid.\n<h2>We still have a long way to go.</h2>\nPolitically, I feel there is more and more representation locally, statewide and nationally; even our Vice President is a woman.\n\nWorking in health care, I'm surrounded by women. Historically, women have dominated health care so when I came to ProMedica, it was no surprise my colleagues would be women as well. I see women physicians, nurses and caring staff everywhere in our healthcare system. This is not surprising nor is this new.\n\nWhat <u>is</u> encouraging is to see how many women are in leadership roles around the organization, not just at the bedside. Everything from supply chain to chief information officer for Provider and Clinical Services, decisions are made by women. I quickly learned that my voice matters. I work in a field and for a company who has time and again respected my opinions, my experience and my abilities regardless of my sex. I feel fortunate.\n<h2>There's more to do.</h2>\nOur U.S. constitution is one of just 28 worldwide that doesn't guarantee gender equality. Neither \"women\" nor \"sex\" are words appearing in the Constitution--showing the limited view our Founding Fathers' had toward the understanding of women as equal citizens. Without specific verbiage in our Constitution, arguments against sex discrimination are under threat. Protections are vulnerable to being rolled back.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nThis Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) would guarantee equal rights to ALL Americans, regardless of sex. It's been 98 years since the Equal Rights Amendment was first introduced in Congress. It's been 49 years since the ERA was passed by Congress, and over a year since the ERA was ratified by the required 38 states. But still, the Equal Rights Amendment has not yet been added to the Constitution. Ratifying the ERA would confirm sex discrimination is inconsistent with our nation's core value of equal protection under the law.\n\nIn the U.S., women still make 78 cents to every man's dollar. This impacts families, what families can earn today, as well as women's future retirement.\n\nLet the work continue to secure and expand equal rights today.\n\nSo, let's celebrate on this very important day. And let's stand with all who toil to gain full rights and privileges. <strong>WE can do better.</strong>\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"alignleft wp-image-8466 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Leslie-Dietsch-297x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"297\" height=\"300\" />\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n<em>Recognizing Women's Equality Day helps us build a culture of inclusion that leverages diversity and creates equity in our workplace, health care and our communities. Learn more about <a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/diversity\">ProMedica’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.</a></em>",

    "Title": "Celebrating Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage",
    "Content": "​<em>The following blog was written by a ProMedica employee in reflection of American Asian Pacific Islander Heritage Month in May 2021. The opinions expressed in this blog are solely the opinions of the author. They do not reflect the opinions of ProMedica or other ProMedica employees.</em>\n\nKorean… that is the answer to the question I've been asked dozens of times. The question…\"What [ethnicity] are you?\"\n\nFor those bold enough to try to answer their own question, the most common I hear is Mexican (or one of several other Latin countries), Indian (not sure if they mean Native American or South Asian -  sometimes I don't know if they know the difference) or Italian; rarely will I get any East Asian country.\n\nMy dad, Gary, was a 6'4\" Sergeant in the U.S. Army and served as a Military Policeman during the Korean War. My mom, Mi Soon, was a 5'1\" firecracker Korean who met my dad while he was stationed in Inchon, Korea. She worked on the base and after a relatively short courtship, when he came back home, he brought her back with him.\n\nWhat I didn't realize until I was much older and after many conversations with her, was how difficult it was for my mom here in the U.S. She was the mother of two boys, which would gain her recognition in Korea, but here, people saw her Asian face, heard her broken English and treated her like she didn't belong.\n\nI saw this firsthand in our hometown of Bedford Township, Michigan. Today, Bedford is 97.56% white and only 0.51% Asian, so imagine what it was like 60 years ago. My mom loved to volunteer and took one opportunity to work as a crossing guard at my elementary school; across the street from the high school, where she would earn her GED by attending night classes. Unfortunately, a few kids would always make fun of her looks and mock her speech. There were times she would get so angry, she would cry. Years later, she told me she wasn't mad at the kids for making fun of her, she was mad at herself because she felt she was bringing shame to our family. That story crushed me because I would never have felt that way, but she did.\n\nMy mother was a traditional Asian woman, selfless and always putting her family first, even to her own detriment. Another detail I didn't realize while I was a child was that she hardly ever ate dinner with us. She would prepare dinner, my dad, brother, and I would sit at the table to eat, but only on special occasions would she join us at the table. Once we finished eating, we would help clear the table, but only then would she sit down to eat. Later, when I was old enough to figure out this was completely weird and awful, she explained her actions by saying it was a way for her to show us that she loved us more than anything else.\n\nShe even sacrificed sharing her life and experiences in Korea with us, which in her mind was to protect us. She told me she was actually afraid to teach us about Korean culture because she was worried my brother and I would be treated like outcasts, as she was when she came here.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nMy mom passed away in 2006 and I wasn't able to spend enough time with her to learn more about that half of my heritage and culture. I see the current treatment of Asians and Asian-Americans today and wonder if we've made ANY progress. Sure, we like Asian food and movies, but what about the people, the languages, the cultural differences? I'm thinking mom would still feel like an outsider, 60 years after coming here.\n\nWhat I do know is that we all would have benefited from knowing my mom--her love for volunteering, how selfless she acted, the pride she felt in her family, and the love she had in her heart. We could all use more of those qualities these days, and Mi Soon was a great example and for me and those who got to know her.\n\n<em>Highlighting Asian American Pacific Islander Heritage Month helps us build a culture of inclusion that leverages diversity and creates equity in our workplace, health care and our communities.

    "Title": "Free STNA Program Helps Develop Careers in Health Care",
    "Content": "Oriana is 20 years old and lives with her mother to share household expenses. Before pursuing her current career path, Oriana was pregnant and working two jobs at different healthcare facilities at an hourly wage. In pursuit of financial stability and a career pathway for her soon-to-be-born child, Oriana decided to explore career paths in health care. During this search, she found out about ProMedica Ebeid Center’s 5-week State Testing Nursing Assistant (STNA) training program.\n\nMoving up the ladder in any career can be a challenge. Finances, education, access to childcare and lack of time were all barriers for Oriana, but she knew that the STNA program could provide the financial and educational pieces she needed. The program offers the STNA courses at no charge and helps pay for testing and scrubs. It also provides free financial coaching, employment and income support, soft skills training, and credit building workshops. Oriana applied, and was accepted into the program in the summer of 2020.\n\nOriana continued to work both jobs while participating in a five-week cohort of STNA candidates. Between both jobs and class time, she was spending about 60 hours per week towards her STNA program. Beyond job and in-class time, she still needed to study, travel to and from employment and class, care for herself and her unborn child, and help manage things around the house. Of course, she was tired, but it didn’t matter; Oriana was willing to reach her goals.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nOriana completed the course later that summer and received her state license as a STNA in Ohio. She knows the program helped set her on a career path and is now poised to pursue a career in nursing! Of course, Oriana didn’t stop there. After she attended the Everything Credit workshop offered by the Financial Opportunity Center (FOC), she was encouraged to do better for herself and her new baby. Oriana wanted to improve her finances even more, so she did just that. Oriana is still working two jobs at different healthcare facilities but has nearly tripled her income.\n\nHer monthly cash flow improved from negative to positive cash flow, she increased her credit score by more than 100 points, improved her financial well-being score and drastically improved her net worth. Oriana is proud of her progress, but again, has set her sights higher. First-time homeownership is Oriana’s next goal. She continues to work with the FOC to help prepare her for this next step. Congrats, Oriana! You are a true example of someone genuinely wanting to change their life!\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-8444 alignnone\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/oriana222.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n<em>For more information about ProMedica Ebeid Center and the STNA program, please visit </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/social-determinants-of-health/in-our-communities/\"><em>ProMedica’s website.</em></a>",

    "Title": "ProMedica Invests Upstream Through a New Diversity in Nursing Initiative",
    "Content": "At ProMedica, we’re committed to addressing the root causes of health inequities for individuals and communities. That includes the systemic issues within our own healthcare industry, including the impact racism, bias and lack of representation among healthcare providers has on quality of health care.\n\nConsider this scenario:\n\n<em>After weeks of headaches and fatigue, Carol finally stopped by a local urgent care facility. The doctor did a general checkup and sent Carol home with orders to start an iron supplement and get more rest. With a full-time job and three kids, she was probably just run-down and borderline anemic.</em>\n\n<em>Carol followed orders, but the fatigue persisted, and she also started to experience muscle and joint aches and the occasional fever. Carol didn’t have a primary care doctor but got a recommendation from a friend and went in for a full check-up. </em>\n\n<em>The nurse who did the pre-exam was Black and has skin of color just like Carol’s. As Carol described her symptoms, the nurse asked if she had noticed any rashes or differences in her skin. Carol pulled up her sleeve to show the nurse a circle of discoloration. The nurse asked if Carol had shown this to the urgent care doctor and Carol said he had just labeled it a slight case of eczema – nothing to worry about. </em>\n\n<em>The examining nurse flagged this for the doctor, who eventually made a diagnosis of Lyme disease, which can become quite serious if left untreated. </em><em>They explained that the rash often presents a bit differently on skin of color and white medical professionals who haven’t seen it on Black or other patients of color before are far less likely to recognize it for what it is.</em>\n\nAlthough this specific story isn’t real, similar experiences happen too often. This is just one example of why it’s so important for medical professionals to reflect the communities they serve. We also know that representation is important. Young people are far more likely to see different career opportunities if they see them reflected in the adults that surround them.\n\nIn the United States, racial minorities accounted for more than one third of the population in 2014, projected to become the majority by 2043. However, only 19.2% of registered nurses (RNs) are from a racial or ethnic minority. Additionally, there is an overall shortage of nurses in the country.\n\nThat is why ProMedica recently launched its Diversity in Nursing scholarship program. Up to 50 scholarships will be awarded annually to students belonging to an underrepresented minority group attending an eligible institution in the ProMedica footprint.\n<h2>Lives Changed</h2>\nThe first class of scholarships was awarded in the fall of 2021, and the stories are already remarkable. Here is some of the feedback from members of the Diversity in Nursing scholarship program:\n\nDebora was born and raised in Brazil and came to the United States 20 years ago on a Green Card lottery. When she first started school, she did not speak English. Now, she says, “In this country there are so many outlets and opportunities that can change a person’s life and this scholarship is one of them. It does not matter where you are from, where you have been, or what you have done. All that matters is that you never give up. This scholarship will change my life and my daughter’s.”\n\nAnother participant, Cory, reflects, “This scholarship means the world to me because it gives me the ability to perform at my highest caliber, without having to worry about how I will afford the laptop and books needed for me to complete daily tasks. It also allows another gay man of color to reside in the world of medicine with the prestige and skillsets of a nurse.”\n<h2>More Opportunities</h2>\nThere are high hopes for this new initiative. Lauryn Vargas, manager of education initiatives at ProMedica, coordinates the program.\n\n“We are thrilled to see the opportunities this scholarship is providing already,” Vargas said. “Not only are we creating a stronger, more diverse pipeline of nurses that can serve the communities in our footprint, but we are seeing the scholarship provide new opportunities for the individual recipients. We are also helping address the overall nursing shortage. It’s a win-win-win!”\n\n<em>Are you interested in the Diversity in Nursing scholarship? There are scholarship dollars still available for the next cohort.

    "Title": "Local Barbers Help Expand Healthcare Access in the Black Community",
    "Content": "When barbershops closed in 2020 due to COVID-19, many Black men in our community felt the loss deeply. That’s because Black-owned barbershops are more than just a place to get a haircut. It’s a home away from home, where Black men can hang out with friends, talk about life and be themselves.\n\nToledo’s barbershops are buzzing again, which is welcomed news for our community. It’s also good news for ProMedica’s Barbershop Program. Launched in 2017, the program brings health education and screenings to eight local barbershops.\n\nThe shops are located in Lucas County zip codes where residents have suffered the most from early death due to poverty, unequal access to health care, low health literacy, and racism.\n\n“Black men in these communities are dying at a younger age compared to those who live elsewhere in Toledo,” says Robin Charney, ProMedica Cancer Institute community liaison. The barbers help us understand the unique challenges Black men face, and work with us to develop programing in an effort to improve the overall health of their clients.”\n<h2>Listening Makes the Difference</h2>\nCharney designed the program with help from barbers, county and state health departments and other ProMedica employees. And the program includes an advisory committee — comprised of barbershop owners and a physician — that meets twice a year. The committee reviews health data in the communities each barbershop serves and plans programs that meet specific needs.\n\nOngoing communication is critical to the program’s success. Charney typically visits the barbershops on Fridays to check in with the barbers, drop off health education materials and talk with customers in the shops. “We enter into these spaces with cultural humility,” she says. “Nobody is an expert on everything. We must take time to listen, learn and work together for the good of the community while building relationships.”\n\nIn the last four years, 40 barbers have participated in the program, which provides education, training and support they can pass along to their clients. For example, barbers:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Have been trained and certified in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).</li>\n \t<li>Received free automated blood pressure cuffs with instruction on how to use them.</li>\n \t<li>Planned community wellness events at their shops where health screenings can take place.</li>\n \t<li>Continue to learn about common health conditions and the importance of cancer screenings.</li>\n</ul>\nA small group of doctors and nurses from ProMedica provides the health screenings. The emphasis is on relationship building, and the vibe is relaxed. “We want our volunteers and barbershop clients to talk and get acquainted,” Charney says. “Our stories may be very different, but we can learn from each other.”\n<h2>Barbers Building Healthier Communities</h2>\nJamal Grant, who owns Da Shop on Toledo’s east side, has been part of the program since the beginning. He says he appreciates the opportunity to help men in his community be healthier. “I grew up here, and it means a lot to be a health advocate for my clients,” he says. “At least three times a week, I’m talking to a client about high blood pressure or prostate cancer or diabetes. I’ve got high blood pressure myself, so it’s real for me, too.”\n\nGrant may offer to check a client’s blood pressure before he leaves the chair. “These guys might not have health insurance or a doctor they trust, but they trust me,” Grant says. “If a client’s blood pressure is borderline or high, I can send him to a doctor who works with the Barbershop Program. I’m very thankful to ProMedica and Robin for reaching out to our community and helping us change attitudes about men’s health.”\n<h2>Outreach That Can Change Lives</h2>\nThe Barbershop Program extends beyond the walls of the barbershop, with community-based programs that build awareness and, sometimes, raise money for the program. One of the most creative events, The Art of the Cut, took place at the Toledo Museum of Art’s GlasSalon. Barbers involved in the ProMedica program performed 16 haircuts in four rounds, inspired by styles through the decades and by works in the museum’s collection. The festive event included museum tours and a live DJ, with a “Barbershop Sharp” dress code.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Charney’s interactions with the barbershop were limited to communicating on Facebook and dropping off health education materials including COVID-19 vaccination information. In recent months, the advisory committee has been meeting again and developing new initiatives. Several of the barbers have talked about a need for understanding mental health issues, Charney says. In response, she is working with behavioral health to provide mental health first-aid training for the barbers in the program. The focus will be on reducing trauma.\n\n“Black-owned barbershops are anchors in the community,” says Charney. “Our hope, both mine and the barbers with whom we collaborate, is that this program will continue to grow and evolve based on mutual respect and a shared response to the needs of the people they serve.”\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>Learn more about the Barbershop Program by watching the video \"Brussels Sprouts\" on our ProMedica Stories page.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/redefining-healthcare/promedica-stories#video-stories\"] View Video [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "Art and Healing: A Conversation with ProMedica's Valerie Thompson",
    "Content": "For many, art is a means of expression, a conversation starter, a way to brighten a space. But for ProMedica graphic designer and Toledo, Ohio, native Valerie Thompson, art is much more than that; it's a form of healing.\n\n“Art has a healing quality to it. You experience it. You feel it. You’re going to be affected by it,” said Thompson. “When you purposefully start to use art in ways that haven’t been done before or in ways that are customized for particular results, you’re going to see a significant and dramatic change in a person.”\n\nWhether it is <a href=\"https://www.arttherapy.org/upload/Research/The%20Value%20of%20Art%20Expression%20in%20Trauma2016.pdf\">used to process difficult emotions after a traumatic event</a>, or <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/fulltext/2006/03250/pilot_study__art_therapy_can_reduce_cancer_related.11.aspx\">even physically reduce pain in cancer patients</a>, art’s healing properties are becoming more and more abundantly clear and accepted by the medical community. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5004743/\">The Journal of the American Art Therapy Association</a> in 2016 found that “45 minutes of creating art in a studio setting with an art therapist significantly lowered cortisol levels.” According to a survey by <a href=\"https://arttherapy.org/blog-coronavirus-impact-report/\">the American Art Therapy Association</a>, “the vast majority (64.5%) [of art therapists surveyed] said they were considered to be ‘essential workers’ by their employers.”\n\nOver the past decade, ProMedica has increasingly sought and implemented art initiatives to promote both individual and community healing, from installing powerful artwork in its facilities to partnering with local artists to create public art installations.\n\nAs a graphic designer at ProMedica for nearly nine years, Thompson is playing a key role in art’s healing impact at the organization.\n\n“For a health care organization to take those facts and proof, and put it to use in a way that will provide an additional layer of healing that’s holistic and natural, I think is revolutionary,” said Thompson.\n\nIn one of ProMedica’s recent initiatives – a docuseries that discusses various topics such as social determinants of health, healthy aging and more – Thompson shares her perspective on art and healing, and how it’s implemented in all aspects of the organization’s community offerings.\n\n“ProMedica has always been a supporter of the arts, but this initiative takes it to the next level. We not only want to support our local art community and beautify our spaces, but we want our patients to have the absolute best, optimal healing experience they possibly can,” she said. “Because art has proven itself to do that, we’re going to use it not just for the patient advantages, but for our entire community, as well.”\n\nAs for the next generation of young artists looking to make an impact in the medical field, Thompson encourages them to find the right mentors. And most importantly:\n\n“Be true to yourself. If you know you like art, and you know that it’s something you’re interested in as far as a career, don’t let anything stop you from figuring out what the next step is in achieving that.”",

    "Title": "ProMedica Farms Grows Healthier Communities",
    "Content": "Driving around Lenawee County in southern Michigan, it’s not unusual to see farms and fields dotting the landscape. Farming is one of the county’s largest industries, and Lenawee is the top corn producer in the state. But nestled in Adrian Township is a farm growing more than just produce. ProMedica Farms, located on the ProMedica Charles and Virginia Hickman Hospital campus, is growing and nurturing healthy habits for county residents.\n\nThe 3-acre farm was created to support ProMedica’s focus on addressing the social determinants of health, or the aspects of health that take place outside the doctor’s office.\n\n“ProMedica Farms supports healthy communities by offering an interactive experience for everyone to see, feel and learn where fresh produce comes from,” says Frank Nagle, director of Community Impact for ProMedica in Michigan. “The program improves food access through our Veggie Mobile and provides opportunities to learn how to garden through an educational series offered to youth groups, schools and senior centers.”\n\nThe goal of ProMedica Farms is to offer fresh fruit and vegetables at affordable prices to improve the health of the community. And the produce grown on the farm is sold in the Veggie Mobile, a mobile farmers market that visits 19 locations throughout the county every week.\n\nThe Veggie Mobile is open to anyone in the community. Patients who identify a need for food receive a voucher to redeem for produce. Veggie Mobile driver Jill Schnur visits senior centers, low-income housing complexes, public locations, the YMCA and the hospital with a truck full of healthy options and helps educate shoppers on the day’s selections.\n\n“ProMedica Farms is a combination of a local source to grow vegetables and produce for the Veggie Mobile, but it also allows us the opportunity for teaching and hands-on education,” says Stacey Tilton, farm coordinator, ProMedica. “It’s a place for the community to come and learn how their food is grown and where it comes from.”\n\nTilton oversees the day-to-day operations for the farm, which includes planting and tending to the 53 different varieties of fruits, vegetables and herbs — everything from artichokes to zucchini. The farm sources additional produce from local growers to provide a greater quantity and assortment of products for the Veggie Mobile. Selection rotates seasonally but often includes lettuce, green beans, tomatoes, kale, radishes and strawberries.\n\n“We offer individual portions to minimize waste and recipes to highlight what’s in season at the farm or from local growers,” says Tilton. “This encourages people to add something new to their diet. Teaching shoppers how to cook and prepare the vegetables is just as important. If you don’t know what to do with sunchokes, it doesn’t really matter how healthy and affordable it is.”\n<h2>Providing a Reliable Source of Fresh Food</h2>\nMany members of the community have come to rely on the Veggie Mobile for their weekly produce shopping.\n\n“Lenawee County is really rural and spread out, so there are a lot of food deserts here,” says Julie Conley, education and support specialist for ProMedica Farms. “Even though we’re an agricultural community, there are a lot of small towns without a grocery store. That’s why the Veggie Mobile started — to grow food for the community and educate people to improve health outcomes.”\n\nFood insecurity increased across the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis. As COVID-19 restrictions kept people away from stores and farmers markets, the Veggie Mobile remained steadfast in its commitment to providing health and wellness through food.\n\n“People knew they could count on the Veggie Mobile to deliver the same quality items even during the pandemic,” says Tilton. “It meant the world to us that we were able to resume operations despite some of our locations being temporarily closed.”\n\nIn 2020, the Veggie Mobile served 6,927 people and donated nearly 6,500 pounds of produce to the community. More than 1,800 pounds of produce sold was harvested from ProMedica Farms.\n\nProMedica Farms also partners with a local school district to donate fruit to students facing food insecurity. While the program started before the pandemic, the need significantly increased during the 2020-2021 school year.\n\n“We’re grateful to have the support of the Michigan Health Endowment Fund and the Lenawee Community Foundation to continue our operations and share ProMedica Farms with the public,” says Tilton.\n<h2>Harnessing the Healing Power of Nature</h2>\nWhile the farm provides a valuable service to the community, it also complements the healing mission of ProMedica. The 900-square-foot clinical hoop house features raised beds at varying heights that make plants easily accessible for children or those in wheelchairs. Railings, parallel bars and staircases within the space can also be used for physical and occupational therapy. And two miles of walking paths on the campus draw patients, visitors and community members.\n\nResearch has shown that gardens in healthcare settings can improve health outcomes. The farm grounds provide a calming green space and a connection to nature to reduce stress and relieve symptoms. A sensory garden within the hoop house offers soothing smells of fresh herbs and flowers and the trickling sounds of a waterfall pond.\n\nAn added benefit of the farm is what Tilton calls “dirt therapy.” Gardening can help strengthen muscles and improve balance while contributing to positive emotional and behavioral health effects.\n<h2>A Community Resource</h2>\nIn addition to the hoop house where fruits and vegetables are grown, ProMedica Farms has an 800-square-foot education center to host schools, garden clubs and community groups.\n\nSince May of 2018, ProMedica Farms has provided 55 educational workshops to 386 students in Lenawee County. Of the youth who participated in the ProMedica Farms three-module education series:\n<ul>\n \t<li>8% self-reported increased consumption of fruits and vegetables.</li>\n \t<li>5% self-reported knowledge of healthy eating behaviors (reading food labels, washing produce, hand hygiene, reducing sugar sweetened beverages).</li>\n \t<li>All engaged in gardening activities including planting, pruning and harvesting fresh Michigan-grown produce.</li>\n</ul>\nWhile COVID-19 put a temporary pause on programming, the ProMedica Farms team is excited to safely resume and build educational opportunities with community partners in the coming months.\n\n“We’re really looking forward to opening up more to the community,” says Conley. “A lot of our education has been up in the air since the start of COVID-19, but we recently got approval to begin hosting small groups again. We look forward to bringing back more cooking classes and growing workshops to address food insecurity and highlight the benefits that come with growing your own food and learning to eat healthier.”\n\n<em>For more information about volunteering or partnering with ProMedica Farms, email promedica.farms@promedica.org.

    "Title": "What Everyone Should Know About the Safety of COVID-19 Vaccines",
    "Content": "As of the end of July, more than 350 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines had been administered in the United States. Still, a significant percentage of the population is missing out on this valuable protection and many people remain concerned about whether it’s safe to take the vaccine.\n\nIf those concerns are keeping you or someone you care about from getting a COVID vaccine, it’s important to know the vaccines are considered very safe for most people and highly effective according to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines.html?s_cid=11304:covid%20vaccine%20types:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY21\">Centers for Disease Prevention and Control</a> (CDC). In fact, the global medical consensus is that COVID-19 vaccines are your best shot at preventing severe COVID illness.\n<h2>Safety Has Always Been a Priority</h2>\nCurrently, there are three COVID-19 vaccines that have received emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The vaccines are manufactured by Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen.\n\nEUAs may be granted by the FDA in public health emergencies like the current pandemic. They allow for the use of medical products to prevent, diagnose or treat medical conditions before the product is fully approved if there are no reliable alternatives.\n\nBut it’s important to note this doesn’t mean the products aren’t carefully studied before receiving EUA status — they are. Clinical trials involving tens of thousands of people evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines before the FDA authorized their use. Then, an independent group of health and science experts reviewed information about the vaccines and recommended their use before the FDA granted the EUA, as well.\n\nIt’s true the vaccines made it to the public quickly, but that was a result of many factors, including a great sense of urgency, knowledge gained from previous research and unprecedented cooperation between those involved in the efforts. Manufacturers also began making the vaccines prior to receiving the EUA, so they’d be on hand if authorization were granted. However, no steps were skipped in the safety evaluation process.\n\nOfficials continue to monitor the effects of the vaccines, and thus far, real world data has confirmed their safety and effectiveness. What’s more, as the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/safety-of-vaccines.html\">CDC reports,</a> “These vaccines have undergone — and will continue to undergo — the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.”\n<h2>How COVID Vaccines Work</h2>\nVaccines work by helping the body’s immune system respond when there’s a threat, such as a virus. The Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are messenger RNA — or mRNA — vaccines. These are a new type of vaccine, although scientists have been studying them for decades. For years, mRNA technology has also had a role in certain cancer treatments.\n\nMessenger RNA is genetic material. It tells your body how to make certain proteins, like those found on the virus that causes COVID. When cells display these proteins, your immune system identifies them as invaders and creates antibodies. So, if you get the virus that causes COVID later, your body will recognize it and be better equipped to fight it off. Getting two doses of these vaccines is more effective than getting one dose.\n\nThe Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is a one-dose vaccine. It uses a weakened virus unrelated to the one that causes COVID to deliver genetic material from the virus that does cause COVID-19. In a way that’s like the mRNA vaccine, this vaccine also causes the body to make the proteins associated with COVID virus. When the immune system recognizes them, it will create antibodies. The antibodies will help you fight COVID if you encounter the real virus later.\n\nNone of the vaccines can give you COVID. However, they may cause temporary, usually mild, side effects, such as swelling or redness at the injection site, fever, tiredness and headache. A severe allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can happen after any vaccine, is possible, too. But it’s rare. And those who offer vaccinations are prepared to quickly treat it, should it happen.\n\nThe Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine has been linked to blood clots, particularly in women, however, they are exceedingly rare. More recently, a potential link between COVID vaccines and heart inflammation has been identified. But again, this is not common and according to the CDC, the benefits of vaccination outweigh these potential risks.\n<h2>Get the Facts</h2>\nWhat is often most frightening for many people about the COVID vaccine is information they hear that’s simply false. Rest assured, there are no microchips in the vaccines, there is no evidence that they impact fertility, and they cannot change your DNA.\n\nWhat the COVID-19 vaccine can do is protect you from a devastating illness that has claimed more than half a million American lives and many more worldwide. Even if the vaccine doesn’t prevent you from getting COVID (no vaccine is 100% effective), it may lower your risk of severe illness and dying from the virus.\n\nFor more information about the COVID-19 vaccines, visit the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines\">U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s website</a>. If you have concerns or questions about your health and the vaccines, your healthcare provider can give you reliable information.\n\nTo find a vaccination site near you, call 1-800-232-0233.",

    "Title": "New Digital Solution Offers Benefits for Employees and Employers Alike",
    "Content": "Business leaders know firsthand that what happens in their employees’ personal lives can have a big impact on what goes on at work. When a single mother has trouble finding quality childcare, for example, she may frequently miss work. Or, if a once-reliable employee is dealing with serious depression, he may call in sick often, or seemingly be preoccupied or distant when he’s on the job.\n\nSituations like these are difficult for workers and their employers. Employee attendance, engagement and productivity suffer, and that affects a business’ bottom line. Throw increased healthcare expenses into the mix — something that becomes more likely when employees have unmet social or economic needs — and the overall costs to a business can be substantial.\n<h2>A Digital Solution</h2>\nProMedica has partnered with Kumanu to create a new employer-focused, digital health and well-being tool, called Resourceful. This innovative solution helps employers get their employees the help they need so that both can benefit.\n\n“The pandemic has highlighted that employees need more support than ever. The latest research reveals that a staggering 1-in-3 employed Americans are struggling with essential needs like food, housing, and financial stability,” says Anthony Goodwin, Director of Resourceful and Market Solutions at ProMedica. “Resourceful provides a way for employers to support their employees during challenging times so employees can come to work more engaged and productive.”\n\nIn development for several years and piloted at ProMedica with thousands of employees, the digital solution is now available to businesses nationwide.\n<h2>How Resourceful Works</h2>\nResourceful is both convenient and confidential.\n\n“It allows employees to get the help they need in a way that makes them feel safe and protected,” says Goodwin.\n\nRather than having to speak with a manager or other employee, they simply complete a five-minute assessment using the app. Here’s how the process works:\n\n1. Via email or print materials with QR codes, employers invite employees to use Resourceful.\n\n2. Through a confidential assessment, interested employees answer 15 or so questions that assess challenges they may be having in the following areas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Food access.</li>\n \t<li>Housing.</li>\n \t<li>Financial well-being.</li>\n \t<li>Childcare.</li>\n \t<li>Transportation.</li>\n \t<li>Depression.</li>\n \t<li>Eldercare.</li>\n \t<li>Internet accessibility.</li>\n \t<li>Relationship safety.</li>\n \t<li>Stress.</li>\n \t<li>Purpose.</li>\n \t<li>Resiliency.</li>\n</ul>\nResponses are confidential and cannot be traced to specific employees. However, those taking the assessment may skip any question that makes them uncomfortable.\n\n3. Resourceful then provides a customized list of resource recommendations based on the employee’s assessment results. In order, the solution directs the employees to appropriate:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Community-level resources, such as food banks or support groups, based on the employee’s zip code.</li>\n \t<li>Employer-sponsored benefits, such as employee assistance programs or financial coaches.</li>\n \t<li>Self-help information, such as videos and tip sheets that are easy to access.</li>\n</ul>\nEmployees who choose to can create an account, so they can easily access the information at any time. But that isn’t required.\n<h2>A Win-Win for All</h2>\nThe Resourceful solution benefits everyone: Employees get the help they need to make life easier and potentially improve their health. At the same time, employers reap the rewards of their employees’ positive feelings about the support they’ve receive at their workplace. They also benefit when employees come to work better-focused, engaged and ready to help the business thrive.\n\nEmployers gain greater insight into how they can help their employees, as well. The solution provides them with de-identified, aggregate data that shows how many employees are using Resourceful, which challenges the employees face, and which resources are accessed most often. It can potentially even help them identify where there are challenges for employees, but not necessarily good resources to assist them.\n\n“It provides the employer an opportunity to better understand where the needs are and where their resources should be focused,” says Goodwin.\n\n<em>To learn more about the Resourceful solution and how it could benefit your employees and business, visit <a href=\"https://www.kumanu.com/resourceful/\">Kumanu’s website.</a></em>",

    "Title": "Safe Travel and Summer Vacations During COVID-19",
    "Content": "Thanks to COVID-19 vaccine availability and low infection rates, summer travel is back on. After being cooped up for over a year and feeling isolated from friends and family, we’re all more anxious than ever to hit the road, take flight or set sail. In fact, TSA checkpoint numbers this June are about four times higher than last June.\n\nThe question on everyone’s mind is how to travel safely post COVID. And the key is getting vaccinated and checking the health landscape where you’re going. “Look at the number of cases, transmission rates, travel rules and mask protocols,” advised Dr. Jennifer Hanrahan, DO, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Toledo Physicians Group and ProMedica. “Everyone should get vaccinated unless they have a medical reason not to,” Dr. Hanrahan says. “These vaccines are incredibly good — even better than we’d hoped for in terms of effectiveness.”\n\nCurrently, the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use authorization for COVID vaccines for ages 12 and older.\n<h2>International Travel</h2>\nThe Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) advises against traveling internationally unless you’re fully vaccinated. If you’re not vaccinated, please follow the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19%5d\">CDC’s international travel recommendations</a> for unvaccinated travelers.\n\nTo be considered fully vaccinated, be sure to follow the dosing schedule and wait two weeks after your second vaccine, whether it's the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine.\n\nEven for vaccinated people, international travel is more complicated. You must:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Get tested no more than three days before you travel by air into the United States.</li>\n \t<li>Show your negative result to the airline before you board your flight.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you’ve been sick while traveling, you’ll also need to show documentation of recovery – proof of a recent positive viral test and a letter from your healthcare provider or a public health official saying that you’ve been cleared for travel.\n\nAnd, for now, you must provide documentation of a negative COVID test even if you’ve been vaccinated or have antibodies.\n\nBefore you plan an international trip, check the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html\">CDC site for updated information per country</a>.\n<h2>Domestic Travel</h2>\nBecause of low infection rates and high vaccination rates, traveling in the U.S. is a safer bet than traveling overseas. According to the CDC, the percentage of the U.S. adult population that has gotten at least one vaccination was about 64% at the beginning of June. “The number of people who've been sick from COVID and have antibodies also contributes to the overall protection in a community,” Dr. Hanrahan said.\n\nSince these statistics vary in different pockets of the United States, be sure to check on the specifics of the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-planner/index.html\">state or city you’re visiting</a>.\n<h2>Airplanes and Hotels</h2>\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, so much was misunderstood and unknown about how the virus spread. One theory that has been debunked is transmission via surfaces. That makes staying in a hotel and flying in an airplane safer than we initially thought.\n\n“In the beginning, people made a big deal about cleaning surfaces, which in general is a good thing, but the reality is that the coronavirus is not spread that way,” Dr. Hanrahan said. “If it were spread by touching contaminated surfaces, many more people would have gotten sick. So, the whole idea that you can get it from a hotel room is not something you need to be worried about.”\n\nOf course, the more crowded the hotel, the higher your risk of infection through coronavirus droplets traveling through the air.\n\nAirlines have taken many steps to purify the cabin air and ensure clean plans. However, studies have found transmission can still happen on airplanes, even with precautions, Dr. Hanrahan said. “If you’re not vaccinated and plan to fly, be sure to have a mask that fits well and keep it over your mouth and nose even while talking.”\n<h2>Your Final Destination</h2>\n“An outdoor location is always going to have a lower risk than an indoor one,” Dr. Hanrahan said. “This will also depend on your underlying risks and whether you’re on any chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy.”\n\nAgain, consider the local transmission rates and look at the safety measures taken if you plan to visit indoor sites or an amusement park. Being vaccinated is the safest bet for a healthy and meaningful summer vacation.\n\n<em>For COVID-19 updates from ProMedica, visit our website, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/covid/\">promedica.org/covid.</a></em>",

    "Title": "Getting Your COVID-19 Vaccine: What to Expect",
    "Content": "It’s the great news we’ve been waiting for. Highly effective vaccines have been developed against COVID-19 — and they’re now more available. Here’s what you need to know.\n<h2>Which vaccine will you get?</h2>\nMore than 200 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been given already in the United States. The available vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson) are highly effective in preventing severe cases of COVID-19, and hospitalization and death from infection.\n\n“We have great data about the safety of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines now and we know they work. No matter which one is available to you, you can feel very comfortable getting it. And I’m optimistic a large percentage of the population is going to be able to get vaccinated in the coming months,” said Dr. Jennifer Hanrahan, infectious disease specialist at the University of Toledo Physicians Group and ProMedica.\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna shots are given in two doses, several weeks apart.\n\nThe third vaccine recently available in the US is the single dose Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) temporarily suspended its use until an independent panel reviewed concerns related to rare blood clots observed in a very small number of vaccine recipients. Since then, the CDC recommended that the use of the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine resume.\n\nPeople who receive the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine are extremely unlikely to experience serious adverse reactions. However, the CDC is recommending that individuals who experience the following rare symptoms after receiving this vaccine seek medical care urgently:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Severe headache</li>\n \t<li>Backache</li>\n \t<li>New neurologic symptoms</li>\n \t<li>Severe abdominal pain</li>\n \t<li>Shortness of breath</li>\n \t<li>Leg swelling</li>\n \t<li>Tiny red spots on the skin (petechiae)</li>\n \t<li>New or easy bruising</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Are there potential side effects?</h2>\nWhile some people won’t feel any side effects from their vaccine, common side effects include pain in the arm where you got the shot and symptoms such as headache or fever.\n\nDr. Hanrahan said that having an immune response such as a fever, body aches and headache after the vaccine is a sign of immune response.\n<h2>Safety after Your Vaccine</h2>\nOnce you’re fully vaccinated, the CDC states that you can start to loosen certain restrictions, such as visiting with other vaccinated people without wearing masks. You should still wear a mask and stay six feet from others when in large crowds indoors or outdoors.\n\n“This is like running a marathon, and we’re on mile 20,” Dr. Hanrahan said. “You might be hitting the wall and feel like you can’t go any further. But the thing is, these are the last few miles we’re going to have to go before we can finish. We just need to hang on a little bit longer and we’ll get there.”\n\nPeople should also be aware that if they have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 before they are fully protected by the vaccine, they can still become infected. So, they should be tested for COVID-19 as they normally would if they have symptoms of COVID.\n<h2>Coronavirus is Now Preventable</h2>\nAccording to Dr. Hanrahan, all eligible people should absolutely take the vaccine as soon as they have the chance to get it. Not getting vaccinated is a decision that puts others at risk. About half the people in any county have risk factors for contracting severe COVID-19, and don’t even know it.\n\n“When I see people coming into the hospital now with a severe case of COVID-19, it makes me incredibly sad. Especially when they’re in a group that could have been vaccinated,” she said. “I think it’s important people realize coronavirus is now preventable. We know what needs to be done.”\n\nTo learn more about the COVID-19 vaccines or schedule your vaccination, visit <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/covid/vaccines\">ProMedica's website</a>.",

    "Title": "What to Know About COVID-19 Variants",
    "Content": "You’ve likely heard about COVID-19 variants. Scientists are studying these new virus forms to learn how they spread and affect people, and to understand if our current treatments and vaccines will work against them. Here’s the latest information.\n<h2>What are variants?</h2>\nWhen viruses spread, small changes or mutations happen as they pass from person to person, creating slightly different strains. The good news is that scientists have been keeping an eye on variants of the virus that cause COVID-19 from the beginning.\n\n“These things happen. It’s just the way viruses work. So, there are variant strains now in different parts of the world and some of these variants may impact our treatment decisions,” says Dr. Jennifer Hanrahan, infectious disease specialist at the University of Toledo Physicians Group and ProMedica.\n\nTo date, variants have been identified in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and in the United States — and some seem to spread more quickly or easily than the original virus.\n<h2>Do our vaccines work against them?</h2>\nOngoing research shows our current COVID-19 vaccines already have quite a bit of ability to protect against new variants. In real world data of people who’ve been vaccinated, the protection has been greater than what we’d ever hoped for. In the beginning when we talked about vaccines, we would have been very happy with a vaccine that was even half as effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. These vaccines have exceeded everybody’s expectation in their performance and are still highly effective against the variants.\n\nWhile Dr. Hanrahan believes it’s likely that booster vaccines will be developed in the future, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get vaccinated now. The priority is to stop the spread of the virus and curb the chances it has to mutate and create new strains.\n<h2>How to Protect Yourself</h2>\nProtecting yourself from the new variants means continuing to take the same safety measures you’ve grown accustomed to over the past several months, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Practicing social distancing.</li>\n \t<li>Using touchless options to make essential transactions.</li>\n \t<li>Washing your hands or using hand sanitizer regularly.</li>\n \t<li>Wearing a mask.</li>\n</ul>\n“It’s going to be awhile before we can ‘return to normal,’ because these variant strains are going to continue for some time,” says Dr. Hanrahan. “And until we have a really large percentage of the population vaccinated, I think we can expect we’re going to continue to have these precautions in place.”\n<h2>An End to the Pandemic</h2>\nWhile we’re on a good path to end the pandemic, it’s important to remember we aren’t out of the woods yet. Anyone who is eligible to get the vaccine should do so when they can.\n\n“The more we can drive down the opportunities for the virus to replicate, because people are immune,” says Dr. Hanrahan, “the greater the likelihood we won’t continue to have this problem in the future.”\n\nTo learn more about the vaccines or make an appointment, visit <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/covid/vaccines\">ProMedica.org</a>.",

    "Title": "What to Know About the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine",
    "Content": "In late February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to prevent COVID-19 in adults. Shipping of the vaccine began immediately, with more than 20 million doses expected throughout the United States in March.\n\nThe Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is different from the other vaccines available from Pfizer and Moderna.\n<h2>A Viral Vector Vaccine</h2>\nBrian Kaminski, DO, vice president of Quality and Patient Safety at ProMedica, says that the primary difference is that the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is a viral vector vaccine.\n\n“Viral vector vaccines use a technology that we’ve used for a long time,” Dr. Kaminski explains. “These vaccines use technology that delivers a message to your cells to generate a response in your body that causes you to produce proteins that your body can recognize and prepare an immune response to the COVID-19 virus. If and when you come into contact with COVID-19, your body is already ready.”\n\nThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not viral vector vaccines, but mRNA vaccines. According to the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mRNA.html\">Center for Disease Prevention and Control</a>, mRNA vaccines give instructions for our cells to make a harmless piece of a “spike protein,” which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the mRNA after it’s finished using the instructions.\n\nViral vector vaccines, like the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine also help our bodies develop the “spike protein.” But they use a modified version of a harmless virus (the vector) to give your body the instructions.\n\nDr. Kaminski stresses that none of the COVID-19 vaccines use the live virus that causes COVID-19. The vaccines cannot infect you with COVID-19 or change your DNA.\n<h2>A Single Dose that’s Effective</h2>\nWhile the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses to be effective, the Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is only one dose. It also doesn’t have to be stored in ultracold freezers, so it’s much easier to ship and store.\n\nThe Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is 66% effective in preventing COVID-19 disease, but more importantly, it is 100% effective in preventing severe disease, as well as hospitalizations and deaths caused by COVID-19.\n\nAlthough there are now three types of vaccines available, individuals will not be able to choose which COVID-19 vaccine they receive when they schedule their vaccination.\n\n<em>For more information on COVID-19 vaccines and distribution, visit </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/covid/vaccines\"><em>ProMedica’s website.</em></a>",

Check the patient’s responsiveness.</h2>\nShake the unresponsive person by the shoulders and speak loudly to them in an attempt to rouse them.\n<h2>2. Check their breathing and pulse.</h2>\nCan you see their chest rising and falling indicating that they are breathing and exchanging oxygen? Can you find a pulse in their neck? If not, the person is likely in need of CPR.\n<h2>3. Call 911.</h2>\nOperators are trained to provide coaching over the phone and can talk you through the steps for administering CPR until emergency medical technicians arrive.\n<h2>4. Administer chest compressions.</h2>\nPlace hands in the center of the chest and begin compressions, hard and fast, at a rate of 100 beats per minute.\n<h2>5. Recheck breathing and pulse.</h2>\nIs the person breathing independently again or is a pulse detectable in the carotid artery? If so, stop compressions. If not, continue compressions until emergency responders arrive.\n\nAdministering chest compressions can be hard to do for a long period of time.

    "Title": "Busted: 10 Myths about COVID-19",
    "Content": "With information constantly changing, it’s hard to keep up. We’re here to safeguard your family’s health by helping you separate the facts from common misconceptions about the new coronavirus.\n<h2>Common Myths</h2>\n<strong>Myth #1: Children, teens and young adults don’t get COVID-19.\n</strong>\n\nFact: Everyone, young and old, can carry or become sick from the virus. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, approximately 21% of COVID-19 deaths have occurred in people younger than age 64.\n\n<strong>Myth #2: COVID-19 cannot thrive in the heat.\n</strong>\n\nFact: While it’s possible that heat could play a role in killing off COVID-19, we can’t be certain without further study. In the meantime, it’s best to assume that the pandemic could last well into the summer months and plan accordingly.\n\n<strong>Myth #3: COVID-19 can spread through food and drinking water.\n</strong>\n\nFact: There’s currently no evidence to suggest you can develop COVID-19 by eating food or drinking water that’s been exposed to the virus. However, you can catch COVID-19 after touching packaging that has the virus on it.\n\n<strong>Myth #4: COVID-19 can be passed from pet to owner (and vice versa).\n</strong>\n\nFact: Experts believe animals don’t play a significant role in spreading COVID-19, but at this time it's also not safe to assume with certainty that they cannot transmit the virus. Washing your hands is an important part of reducing the spread of germs when handling your pets, their food, and their equipment.\n\n<strong>Myth #5: If you have COVID-19, you’ll know it.</strong>\n\nFact: The data gathered so far suggests that many infected with COVID-19 will have no symptoms at all. To further complicate matters, symptoms can take up to two weeks to appear from the time you first come in contact with the virus.\n\n<strong>Myth #6: Antibiotics can help prevent and treat COVID-19.</strong>\n\nFact: Antibiotics work on bacterial infections, not viruses like COVID-19. Only take an antibiotic if your doctor prescribes it.\n\n<strong>Myth #7: It’s unsafe to take ibuprofen to relieve COVID-19 symptoms.</strong>\n\nFact: Since we’re still learning about the new coronavirus, the data isn’t clear. At this point, there’s no proven, direct link between the use of ibuprofen and worsened COVID-19 outcomes.\n\n<strong>Myth #8: Consuming or using cleaning products on your body can kill COVID-19.</strong>\n\nFact: Cleaning products cannot kill COVID-19 once they’ve entered your body. Drinking chlorine, alcohol or bleach, or spraying it on your body, is extremely dangerous.\n\n<strong>Myth #9: Homemade, cloth face coverings aren’t effective.</strong>\n\nFact: COVID-19 spreads through respiratory droplets created when a person coughs, sneezes or talks. Cloth face coverings, even those made at home, can help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n\n<strong>Myth #10: Wearing gloves will decrease your chance of getting COVID-19.</strong>\n\nFact: To date, no official recommendations have been made to wear gloves when you’re out in public. In fact, many experts believe that wearing gloves could cause more harm than good. Since people tend to touch their face more often when they wear gloves, they could actually be increasing their risk of getting the virus.\n<h2>How to Protect Yourself from COVID-19</h2>\nTo reduce your risk of getting COVID-19, you should:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Avoid touching</strong> your face.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Clean and disinfect </strong>frequently touched surfaces daily.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Cover coughs and sneezes </strong>with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face covering</strong> when in public.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Keep at least 6ft away </strong>from other people.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stay home </strong>as much as possible.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Wash your hands often</strong> with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n<em>Sources: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, World Health Organization, and World Organisation for Animal Health</em>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h4 style=\"text-align: center;\">Stay up-to-date with COVID-10 updates and resources.</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/COVID-19.aspx\"] Go to ProMedica's Resource Center [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "Hunger and Obesity: How These Two Nutrition-Related Issues Are Connected",
    "Content": "When one thinks about hunger in America, the image of someone who is obese generally isn’t the first thing to come to mind. The two health issues seem to be on opposite ends of the nutrition spectrum, so how could an individual face both at the same time?\n\nHunger doesn’t always mean having little or nothing to eat. Food insecurity – where people do not know where their next meal will come from – plays a part in U.S. hunger, too. Consistent access to nutritious food is needed to be healthy, active and food secure.\n\nFood insecurity is closely linked with poverty: About 75% of Americans who were food insecure in 2011 were at or below 185% of the poverty level, according to data reported by Feeding America. That means a family of four had an annual income of about $41,000 or less to provide food, clothing, shelter, and other basic needs, which can be a challenge.\n\nFamilies who are food insecure and low income have many unique circumstances that may put them at a high risk for being overweight or obese. Some of these factors include limited financial resources for healthy food, decreased access to healthy food and activities, and unhealthy eating patterns.\n\n<b>Limited Budget, Limited Options</b>\n\nUnhealthy food is generally cheap and accessible in America. A limited food budget may lead a family who is struggling with food insecurity to choose more high-calorie, energy-dense food. They may opt for sugary fruit drinks, french fries and chips, for example, instead of more expensive – yet healthier – fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\nAlthough some food insecure individuals may consume enough of these low-quality foods to prevent physical hunger, they are also consuming too much fat and a lack of adequate vitamins and minerals. This can contribute to obesity and poor nutrition.\n\n<b>Living in a Food Desert</b>\n\nEven if an individual is motivated to choose healthy food, access is often lacking in low-income neighborhoods. Local stores may not carry many fresh fruits and vegetables, and larger grocery stores may be too far away for some families to travel to. In addition, opportunities for physical activity outside are often limited in certain low-income neighborhoods due to safety, which only adds to the weight problem.\n\n<b>Evaluating Eating Patterns</b>\n\nThe feast and famine eating patterns that some with food insecurity face can also contribute to an unhealthy weight. The famine stage, when inadequate food is available, can lead to a decrease in metabolism as our bodies try to conserve as much energy as they can. Then, when food is more plentiful and we feast, our bodies are still in the habit of trying to conserve energy, which can lead to an unhealthy weight gain.\n\nFinally, the high stress that is associated with food insecurity and poverty has also been linked with unhealthy eating habits and greater weight gain. High levels of stress have been associated with behaviors such as overeating, and it may even lead to higher levels of anxiety and depression. In addition, high stress may lead to changes in the body’s metabolism and hormone levels, which can have a negative effect on weight.\n\n<b>Making a Difference</b>\n\n[row]\n\n[column md=\"6\" sm-\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nData from Feeding America indicates that 50 million Americans, or 16.4% of the U.S. population, were considered food insecure in 2011, with more than 2 million Ohioans in this category. ProMedica is based in Lucas County, Ohio, where an estimated 83,000 residents, or almost 19% of the population, were food insecure in 2011. This indicates a greater need to address food insecurity in our area.\n\nAt ProMedica, we are especially concerned with hunger and food insecurity among vulnerable populations, including children.\n\n[/column]\n\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]<img class=\"img-responsive alignleft wp-image-1067 size-full\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Chloe_Garden-Grocer_IMG_2843.jpg\" alt=\"Chloe_Garden Grocer_IMG_2843\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1067\" />\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\nPeriods of food insecurity in youth can negatively affect many aspects of a child’s development, leading to decreased physical health, delayed cognitive development, decreased academic achievement, and impaired mental and emotional health.\n\nBecause hunger and obesity can be interconnected, it is vital that we consider both issues when trying to address one or the other. Simple actions can help address the overall problem, such as donating healthy items to food banks, encouraging families who are eligible to participate in free or reduced-priced meal programs at schools, and supporting the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps.\n\nTo learn more about obesity and food insecurity in kids, view the <a href=\"http://www.eatrightpro.org/resource/media/multimedia-news-center/infographics/nourish-to-flourish-infographic\">Nourish to Flourish Infographic</a> from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n\n<i>Chloe Berdan, MS, RD, LD, is a clinical dietitian with ProMedica Advocacy and Community Health, and her main </i><i>passion is promoting childhood and adolescent health and wellness.
