    "Title": "Kidney Disease and Your Treatment Options",
    "Content": "While there is no cure for kidney disease, there are lifestyle changes that you can make to slow its progression, and effective treatment options available to manage the condition.\n<h2>What is kidney disease?</h2>\nKidney disease is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function. “When the kidneys are damaged and stop working as they should, high levels of waste build up,” shares Keri Lease, RN, manager at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-fostoria-community-hospital-dialysis-center\">ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Dialysis Center</a>.  As a result, excess fluid and waste from the blood remain in the body and may cause other problems such as heart disease and stroke.\n\n“Kidney disease has varying levels of seriousness,” explains Amy Bowser, RN, manager at <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-fostoria-community-hospital-dialysis-center\">ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Dialysis Center</a>. “It usually gets worse over time, though treatment has been shown to slow progress. If left untreated it can progress to kidney failure and early cardiovascular disease.”\n<h2>What are the symptoms?</h2>\nThere are often no symptoms in the early stages of kidney disease. However, as kidney function decreases over time, additional symptoms present themselves. Common symptoms of chronic kidney disease include nausea, loss of appetite, changes in urination, muscle cramping, fatigue, swelling in the legs, feet and hands, trouble sleeping, high blood pressure and decreased mental sharpness.\n<h2>What are the risk factors?</h2>\nRisk factors for developing kidney disease include family history, obesity and other conditions such as diabetes or heart disease. Overuse of over-the-counter pain relievers can also contribute to kidney damage over time.\n\n“To lower your risk of developing kidney disease, maintain a healthy weight, don’t smoke, use over-the-counter pain medications correctly and manage any other existing conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, as recommended by your provider,” Lease shares.\n<h2>What treatment options are available?</h2>\nTreatment options for kidney disease range based on the stage of the disease. In the beginning stages, conservative management options such as lifestyle changes such as exercising daily and eating healthy can be very effective in slowing the progression of the disease. Controlling any disease-related or preexisting medical conditions is also very important to managing kidney disease, so your doctor may prescribe medications to help manage these conditions.\n\n“Conservative management practices can help manage symptoms and preserve kidney function and quality of life for as long as possible,” shares Bowser. “When the kidneys stop working, dialysis or kidney transplant is necessary for survival.”\n<h3>Dialysis</h3>\nThere are two types of dialysis available: hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\n“Hemodialysis uses a machine to move your blood through a filter outside of your body that removes wastes,” Bowser shares. “Whereas peritoneal dialysis uses the lining of your peritoneum (the membrane lining your stomach) to filter your blood inside your body.”\n\nAt <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-fostoria-community-hospital-dialysis-center\">ProMedica Fostoria Community Hospital Dialysis Center</a>, experts utilize hemodialysis to help patients we help patients manage their kidney disease.\n\nHemodialysis utilizes a machine that acts as your kidney by filtering blood to remove harmful wastes and excess fluid. “This helps control blood pressure and maintain a healthy balance of fluids and minerals in your blood,” Lease shares.\n\nHemodialysis requires a strict treatment schedule with treatments occurring three to four days a week, for three to four hours per treatment. While this is a serious time commitment, Lease reminds patients that dialysis can be a key factor in helping them continue to live life to the fullest as they continue to live with kidney disease. Hemodialysis may also be done at home if the patient meets the necessary requirements.\n\n“Many patients who follow their treatment plan experience more energy, better sleep and less cramping and headaches,” Lease explains. “Hemodialysis can be a valuable tool in helping patients feel the best that they can while they are managing kidney disease.”\n\n<a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/body-and-conditions/tips-for-coping-with-hemodialysis-treatment/\">Learn more</a> about dialysis and tips to coping with the treatment.",

    "Title": "Colon Polyps: What are they?",
    "Content": "If you have ever had a colonoscopy or know someone who has, you may have heard of colon polyps. But what are they? Why is it important to get them removed?\n<h2>What is a colon polyp?</h2>\nColon polyps are growths in the inner lining of the large intestine. They are made up of a small clump of cells and vary in size from less than a quarter inch to several inches in diameter.\n\nOften times polyps start as harmless. However, polyps can be precancerous, which if not removed in time during a colonoscopy, will grow into cancer.\n<h2>Who develops colon polyps and why?</h2>\nAccording to the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, more than 40% of people over 50 have precancerous polyps in their colon. Most often, age is the most significant risk factor for developing polyps, specifically being over 50 years old. Other risk factors include obesity, smoking, diabetes, family history, eating too much processed food and red meat, excess alcohol use and a history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that regular screening for colorectal cancer begin at age 45 and continue to be tested at regular intervals. Some people may need to be screened earlier than 45 if there is a family history of colorectal cancer or colon polyps. A primary care physician can help to determine a patient’s risk and recommend screening at the proper time.\n<h2>Do colon polyps have symptoms?</h2>\nColon polyps typically do not present with symptoms. It takes about five to 10 years for a polyp to develop into cancer, so it is important to get routine colonoscopies when eligible to prevent the risk of developing cancer.\n\nSome people with colon polyps may experience rectal bleeding, a change in bowel habits, unexplained weight loss or abdominal pain. If any of these symptoms are present, it is important to seek evaluation by a physician to ensure no polyps or colorectal cancer is present.\n<h2>Why should colon polyps be removed?</h2>\nWhen a polyp is found during a colonoscopy, the physician can remove it and send it to be tested for cancer. The success rate of finding a polyp during a colonoscopy is about 95%. Colonoscopies are the only procedure that can remove polyps before they become cancer.",

    "Title": "Healthy Eating for People Living with Dementia",
    "Content": "Food is an important part of our lives. It provides nourishment, helps us celebrate our culture, and creates moments for joy and togetherness. For those living with dementia, having the right accommodations can make a big difference in preserving the many benefits around mealtimes.\n\n“Food is universal and connects us to our most cherished moments,” explains Chef Nancy Gierwielaniec, senior food services coordinator with Arden Courts ProMedica Memory Care. “Loved ones living with dementia should continue to experience connections over a meal. It should provide much needed structure, and time to enjoy family and friends.”\n\nGierwielaniec has 30 years of culinary experience, and for the past 19 years, has helped provide delicious and nutritious meals to those living with dementia. She knows dementia can bring several challenges related to eating and nutrition.\n\nIf your loved one has dementia, Gierwielaniec offers the following tips to help you and your loved one continue to enjoy food and mealtimes.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Consider the MIND diet.</strong> This diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean diet (a heart healthy eating plan) and the DASH diet (used to prevent or treat high blood pressure). It’s often recommended by physicians and experts in memory care. The diet is rich in vegetables, whole grains, fruit, protein and olive oil.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Aim for nutrient-dense, seasonal foods.</strong> Shopping in season helps you find the foods with the best flavor and highest nutrients. Local foods spend less time in travel, so consider a stop at your local farmer’s market. When you’re at the grocery store, try to find seasonal produce and shop the perimeter at your store, which has fewer preserved and processed foods.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Modify foods and eating tools.</strong> Dementia can affect a person’s physical abilities. Watch for changes in your loved one’s ability to swallow and handle flatware. Opt for fork-friendly foods and finger foods if needed. Foods like spaghetti, fine noodles and rice may be difficult to eat. Cut protein into strips, prepare tender cooked potatoes and vegetables that are easy to eat and consider serving sandwiches.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Be aware of sensory experiences.</strong> The eating experience is more than just taste; sight, smell and sounds all make a difference at mealtime. Make sure the dining space is well lit and there is visual contrast with the food, as well as dinnerware and linens. For instance, a meal of chicken, mashed potatoes and cauliflower could benefit from a colored plate. As dementia progresses, sweetening food with sugar or honey can help keep foods from tasting bitter to your loved one. Remember to keep the setting simple by placing only the necessary eating tools on the table.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Keep dining out enjoyable.</strong> A familiar restaurant can be a fun outing for your loved one. Choose a place with a calmer, quieter environment and go at an ideal time of day, such as before the dinner rush. Suggest one or two meals from the menu you know your loved one likes to keep decision making easier. Remember your loved one may tire easily, so look for signs that they are tired. Keep the outing short by skipping the appetizer and taking the dessert home.</li>\n</ul>\nStrategies to achieve good nutrition and maintain healthy eating habits for your loved one may change as their dementia progresses. Talk with your loved one’s physician and seek help from a memory care community near you.\n\nFor more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.arden-courts.org/locations\">www.arden-courts.org/locations</a>.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"6\" sm=\"6\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/Healthy-Eating-for-People-Living-with-Dementia.pdf\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-8940 size-large\" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/Healthy-Eating-for-People-Living-with-Dementia-410x1024.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"410\" height=\"1024\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]",

    "Title": "4 Common Varicose Vein Myths",
    "Content": "Varicose veins are a common condition causing twisted, enlarged veins commonly visible in the legs and feet. While varicose veins are generally benign, certain health considerations should be determined before chalking it up to a cosmetic issue. Because the severity of varicose veins varies, Andrew Seiwert, MD, FACS, a vascular surgeon at ProMedica, debunks common varicose vein myths.\n<h2>Myth: Varicose veins are a cosmetic issue and do not need to be treated.</h2>\nAccording to the Society for Vascular Surgery, nearly two in five Americans will experience venous insufficiency in their lifetime. This happens when blood flows too slowly, not at all, or backward – causing it to pool in the blood vessels of the legs and not be able to pump back up to the heart. When the blood pools, some veins will become enlarged and appear dark, twisted and bulging from the skin. This occurrence is what we commonly refer to as varicose. Varicose veins can cause increased pressure, fatigue, bulging veins, itching, swelling, skin changes, ulceration, heavy legs and skin discoloration. Some varicose veins may appear due to changes in hormones, as a result of being overweight or are inherited from family members.\n\n“Varicose veins are never life or limb-threatening, but they are at the very least a daily aggravation,” Dr. Seiwert explains. “Left unchecked, advanced venous disease can lead to painful, disabling symptoms. It’s important to remember that all major vein problems started out as small ones.”\n\nIf you have varicose veins, seeking early treatment can help to prevent more serious health problems from occurring.\n<h2>Myth: Only women get varicose veins.</h2>\nWomen are more likely to develop varicose veins, likely due to cyclic monthly hormones and blood flow changes associated with pregnancy, but genetics and other factors also play a big role in the likelihood of developing the condition.\n\nVaricosities tend to be passed down through families. If a woman has varicose veins, her daughter has a 90% chance of developing the condition and her son will only have around a 20% chance.\n\n“Men, however, tend to comprise around 40% of all cases,” Dr. Seiwert shares. “Obesity and prior blood clots also factor heavily.”\n<h2>Myth: Crossing your legs when sitting will give you varicose veins.</h2>\n“Crossing of the legs has nothing to do with varicose veins,” said Dr. Seiwert.\n\nExternal pressure like crossing the legs or wearing tight pants does not exert enough force to damage the veins or cause varicosities. The concern arises when an individual works a job in which walking is minimized. Sitting or standing in one spot for an extended period puts the calf muscle in standby mode, allowing blood to pool in the leg.\n\nMaking an effort to alternate between sitting and standing throughout the day can help prevent blood from pooling in the legs. Also wearing compression stockings can help if it isn’t possible to move around throughout the day.\n<h2>Myth: Surgery is the only treatment for varicose veins.</h2>\nThere are several options for the treatment of varicose veins, and the first is always non-surgical. “Varicose vein treatment plans include a three-month trial of exercise, weight loss, limb elevation and compression stockings.” Dr. Seiwart explains. “Commonly, symptoms improve after this three-month treatment plan.”\n\nMinimally invasive treatment options are available for patients who do not have a resolution after trying a non-surgical approach.\n\nTwo of the most common treatments are sclerotherapy and endovenous thermal ablation. Both sclerotherapy and endovenous thermal ablation close off the vein and redirect the blood flow to healthier veins. The difference is in the method. Sclerotherapy involves a chemical solution that is injected into a vein and endovenous thermal ablation uses heat to cauterize the vein lining. Both of these treatments are done under local anesthesia and have a 96-96% success rate.\n\n“Patients will get off of the procedure table after having treatment and are surprised that their leg feels better right off the bat,” said Dr. Seiwert. “Some will even go back to work the same day. Remembering that vein operations 25 years ago required general anesthesia, hospitalization and occasional blood transfusion, this improvement in patient care is truly remarkable.”",

    "Title": "6 Ways To Ease Dental Anxiety",
    "Content": "If the thought of going to the dentist makes your teeth chatter, you’re not alone. In fact, dental anxiety is considered one of the main barriers to patients receiving dental care. Learn about six strategies you can practice to ease any anxiousness before your next visit.\n<h2>1. Talk with your dentist ahead of time.</h2>\nLet your dentist’s office know that you often experience anxiousness at the dentist prior to your visit. There may be certain things that they can do, such as allot more time for your appointment, allow you to split your appointment up into shorter, more manageable visits or provide you with additional tools to help calm your nerves.\n<h2>2. Go to the dentist regularly.</h2>\nVisiting the dentist for routine cleanings is very important. Typically, dentists recommend a cleaning every six months for those with good oral health.\n\n“Your gut instinct may be to avoid the situation that makes you anxious, but avoiding it will only create more anxiety,” shares Jackie Van Zile, a licensed professional clinical counselor (LPCC) with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-behavioral-health-sylvania\">ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania</a>. “If you only go to the dentist when you’re in pain, you may unintentionally create an association in your brain between the dentist and pain.”\n\nOnly going to the dentist when something hurts is also a poor approach. “Fifty percent of the time, if a tooth is hurting, it’s already beyond simple treatment,” shares Terry Norris, DMD, the lead consulting dentist for Paramount Dental. “Waiting until you have a toothache will only result in more money spent and likely increased anxiety due to a more invasive procedure.”\n<h2>3. Find the right dentist and appointment time.</h2>\nDr. Norris recommends that patients who experience dental anxiety schedule their appointments first thing in the morning. Doing this will allow you to complete your visit first thing and not allow for anxiousness to build throughout the day. Avoiding drinking any caffeine before your visit is also a good idea.\n\nTake the time to find a dentist you trust and develop a good relationship with your dentist. “Our job as dentists is to diagnose and make treatment recommendations, not to make decisions,” shares William Moorhead, DMD, an expert in dentistry and dental sedation. “Find a dentist that makes you feel comfortable and puts you in control of your dental health.”\n\nConsider your dentist as part of your team. They want the best for you and your oral health!\n<h2>4. Determine a non-verbal form of communication.</h2>\nBefore the hygienist or dentist begins their work, determine a non-verbal form of communication that you can use to ask them to stop. Since talking may be difficult, a determined non-verbal cue, such as raising your hand, is a great way to tell your dentist that you need a break. “The dentist or hygienist may be the one holding the tools, but you, as the patient, are in control,” Dr. Moorhead shares.\n<h2>5. Evaluate medicinal options.</h2>\nYour dentist may be able to offer a variety of medicinal options to help calm your anxiety. Common pharmaceuticals used for dental anxiety range from drugs such as nitrous oxide (laughing gas) and valium, to deeper sedation administered by a dentist with advanced training or a nurse anesthetist.\n\nAdditional pharmaceuticals and techniques may vary by the dental office. In addition to moderate sedation, Dr. Moorhead utilizes a unique technique with his patients that experience dental anxiety called NuCalm. NuCalm involves a pair of noise-canceling headphones that play a slightly different frequency in each ear to activate the parasympathetic nervous system and help calm your mind. Ask your dentist what options might be available to you.\n<h2>6. Address your triggers.</h2>\n“Dental anxiety often stems from a negative experience at the dentist,” Van Zile explains. “And society’s portrayal of dentistry doesn’t help either (think <em>Finding Nemo</em> and dental chairs in horror movies). Visiting the dentist also puts you in a very vulnerable position. Someone is invading your space and you’re not able to see what they’re doing or communicate with them while they’re doing it.”\n\nTo help yourself feel more in control, Van Zile recommends you utilize the following techniques:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Ask questions.</strong> Before your dentist does anything, ask them to first tell you what they are going to do and then show you what that might look like and the tools that they will use to do it.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Utilize distractions.</strong> Helpful distractions may include bringing headphones to listen to music during your treatment, or essential oils to smell when you begin to feel nervous.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Practice mindfulness</strong> before and during your visit. It’s really hard to feel anxious in a relaxed body. If you begin to feel yourself tensing up, stop, relax and practice a <a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/general-health/what-is-grounding-and-how-can-it-improve-your-mental-health/\">relaxation (or grounding) technique</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n“Also don’t be afraid to give yourself some encouragement throughout the visit,” Van Zile shares. “Tell yourself that you’re doing a great job staying relaxed, and that you’re onto the next step and even closer to being done. Then after the visit is over, take time to praise yourself for accomplishing the visit.”\n\nDr. Norris adds that a good dentist will also offer praise as the cleaning or procedure goes along. “I always make a point to let the patient know when the hardest part of the procedure is over,” Norris shares. “Praise and reassurance go a long way in helping an anxious patient manage their fears.”\n\nVisiting the dentist can create unwanted anxiety for the best of us. Taking time to practice these techniques and acknowledging that your dental health will be better off with routine dental visits can help.",

    "Title": "What is structural heart disease?",
    "Content": "Structural heart disease is a general term used to describe conditions that involve damage to or flaws in the anatomy or structure of the heart. Common <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/structural-heart-disease#overview\">structural heart disease conditions</a> include narrowed or leaking heart valves, and abnormal connections such as holes in the walls separating the heart chambers or vessels.\n\nYou may be born with structural heart disease or it may develop later in life. It’s important to note that it's different from coronary heart disease, which is a result of plaque in the arteries.\n\n“Structural heart disease isn’t necessarily caused by anything you do or don't do,” <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/stephanie-younes-md-facc-fscai-interventional-cardiology\">Stephanie Younes, MD, FACC, FSCAI</a>, interventional cardiologist with the <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-structural-heart-clinic\">ProMedica Structural Heart Clinic</a> explains. “It may be something you are born with, or a result of degenerative disease, meaning wear and tear on the heart valves.” It can also be caused by infections of the heart valves or damage from previous heart attacks.\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\nSome patients don’t experience any symptoms of structural heart disease in the early stages. Because of this, structural heart conditions are often discovered by accident, such as during a routine exam. However, if you do have symptoms, they may include shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness, fatigue, heart palpitations or flutters, coughing when laying down or swelling of the ankles.\n\nIf left untreated, structural heart disease can lead to damage to the heart and other organs or even heart failure.\n<h2>Reducing Your Risk</h2>\nStructural heart disease isn't something you can prevent entirely. But there are a few things that you can do to lower your risk of developing the disease or stop the disease from progressing before heart damage occurs.\n\nMost importantly, make sure that you are seeing your doctor for yearly physicals. “Whether it’s your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?Keyword=primary%20care\">primary care physician</a> or your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=9&amp;SpecialtyText=Cardiology\">cardiologist</a>, it’s important to see a doctor periodically,” Dr. Younes shares. Early recognition is key and helps avoid possible irreversible heart damage.\n\nEating a well-balanced diet that is low in sodium and exercising may also lower your risk of developing some forms of structural heart disease and accompanying coronary artery disease.\n<h2>Treatment Options</h2>\nIf your doctor notices something abnormal during an exam or you are experiencing symptoms of structural heart disease, a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/structural-heart-disease#collapse2\">series of tests</a> will be performed. These tests may include an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart), CT scan, MRI or cardiac catheter of the heart.\n\n“<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/structural-heart-disease#collapse3\">Treatment</a> of structural heart disease has been revolutionized over the past two decades,” Dr. Younes shares. “There’s a wide array of minimally invasive, percutaneous treatment options.\" Interventional cardiologists are able to enter the heart through little arteries and veins accessed by small incisions. The incisions are about the size of a pen and often allow surgeons to avoid a more invasive procedure.\n\nAt ProMedica, the whole procedure is mapped out before a single incision is ever made. This is made possible by our advanced CT scanners. “The scanners produce a pristine and very detailed image of the heart. These images allow us to not only diagnose problems but also plan our procedures appropriately,” Dr. Younes shares.\n\nEach case is then reviewed by our multidisciplinary team of image-reading specialists, interventional cardiologists and cardiothoracic surgeons. The team then works together to determine their best treatment plan.\n\n“Whether your condition is something that you were born with or something that has developed and progressed over time, our job is to do our best to limit any heart damage and help you live the longest and fullest life that you can live,” Dr. Younes concludes.",

    "Title": "Could you be suffering from postpartum depression?",
    "Content": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious mental health condition that can affect new mothers in weeks or months following childbirth. This condition affects around 20 percent of new mothers, although the true prevalence may be higher because of underdiagnosis and underreporting due to cultural, economic and political factors.\n<h2>What is postpartum depression?</h2>\nIt is a serious condition that can have a significant impact on a woman's well-being, as well as her ability to care for her newborn. It is characterized by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, irritability, loss of interest in activities that the person used to enjoy, along with physical symptoms such as fatigue, changes in appetite and difficulty sleeping. Some women may also experience challenges bonding with their baby or have thoughts of harming themselves or their baby. In severe cases, women may experience psychosis, which can include hallucinations or delusions.\n<h2>What causes postpartum depression?</h2>\nPPD is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including hormonal changes sleep deprivation and stress, but researchers are still trying to understand the exact causes. Risk factors for PPD include a history of depression or anxiety, a difficult pregnancy or delivery, and a lack of support from family and friends.\n<h2>What treatment options are available?</h2>\nThere are a variety of effective treatments available. Recommended treatment for mild to moderate cases of PPD may include support groups for emotional and social support, and psychotherapy like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and interpersonal therapy (IPT). These treatments can help mothers and caregivers identify and change negative thought patterns, and help adapt new roles that may be effective. For more severe cases, antidepressant medication may be prescribed in addition to psychotherapy. A treatment plan for PPD should be developed in consultation with a health care professional, considering the individual's symptoms and preferences.\n\nIt's important to know that postpartum depression is a treatable condition, and there is no shame in seeing help. Many new mothers experience PPD, and it is important for them to know that they are not alone and that there is help available. It is also important for family and friends to be aware of PPD and to support new mothers who may be struggling. It's also important to note that PPD can also occur in new fathers, people who have given birth via surrogacy or adoption, and those who have experienced a loss of a child through miscarriage or stillbirth. The symptoms and treatment are largely similar.\n\nIn conclusion, postpartum depression is a very common condition that affects many new mothers and can have serious consequences for mother, child and families if left untreated. It’s important for women to be aware of the symptoms and seek out help as soon as possible. With the right treatment, mothers can recover and can go on to have healthy and fulfilling relationships with their babies.",

    "Title": "Understanding Your Options for Hernia Repair",
    "Content": "Hernias are common, with an estimated 5 million Americans having a hernia. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/tahir-jamil-md-general-surgery\">Tahir Jamil, MD,</a> a board-certified general surgeon and co-director of <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/hernia\">ProMedica’s Comprehensive Hernia Program</a>, answers common questions about hernias and hernia repair.\n<h2>What is a hernia?</h2>\nA hernia is a defect, opening or tear in the abdominal wall muscles. They can occur anywhere in the abdominal cavity themselves. Hernias we commonly treat include inguinal hernia, ventral hernias, Spigelian hernias, incisional hernias, recurrent hernias, hernia incarceration/strangulation, diaphragmatic hernias and rectus diastasis.\n\nThere are many different reasons why people have hernias. Hernias are common in men and women of all ages. Hernias usually occur either because of a natural weakness in the abdominal wall or from excessive strain on the abdominal wall, such as the strain from heavy lifting, substantial weight gain, persistent coughing, or difficulty with bowel movements or urination. Hernias can commonly occur after prior abdominal surgery or from re-occurrences from prior repairs.\n<h2>How do I know if I have a hernia?</h2>\nNot all hernias cause symptoms and require treatment. However, if you have a hernia, you may experience any of the following symptoms:\n<ul>\n \t<li>A noticeable protrusion in the groin area or abdomen.</li>\n \t<li>Feeling pain while lifting.</li>\n \t<li>A dull aching sensation.</li>\n \t<li>A vague feeling of fullness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Are hernias dangerous?</h2>\nAbdominal hernias are common and not necessarily dangerous. But, a hernia doesn’t usually get better on its own. In rare circumstances, it can lead to life-threatening complications. Consequently, surgery is usually recommended for a hernia that’s painful or becoming larger.\n\nEven though your hernia isn’t causing any symptoms, it's important that you have it regularly evaluated by your doctor. He or she will want to keep an eye on it and reassess the situation ─ even if it becomes just slightly uncomfortable. Some people wear a supportive belt or undergarment to hold the hernia in, but this isn’t a long-term solution.\n<h2>How are hernias treated?</h2>\nTreatments we offer with ProMedica’s Comprehensive Hernia Program include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Minimally invasive robotic surgery.</li>\n \t<li>Laparoscopic surgery.</li>\n \t<li>Open surgical hernia repair.</li>\n</ul>\nRobotic surgery has allowed us to push the envelope of simple and complex hernia repairs. Robotic surgery allows us to treat hernias with smaller incisions, which can translate into people having less pain and a shorter length of stay in the hospital. On average, most hernia repairs undertaken with ProMedica’s Comprehensive Hernia program stay less than a day in the hospital after a hernia repair.\n<h2>What happens after someone has hernia surgery?</h2>\nPatients who are eligible for minimally invasive robotic surgery usually have less pain and a faster return to normal activity. Our patients can experience less discomfort than with traditional approaches. Most of our patients have a 10-pound weight restriction for about two weeks, but after that, the person can slowly resume normal activity.\n\nGenerally, patients undergoing minimally invasive robotic hernia surgery will require less narcotic pain medications when compared with standard techniques. Because of the dedication and commitment to robotic hernia surgery, surgeons with ProMedica’s Comprehensive Hernia Program have a very low complication rate when compared with traditional surgery. Complications from robotic surgery are in the single digits, compared to the 20% complication rate of open surgery for large hernias.\n<h2>Is it OK to ignore a hernia that isn’t causing pain?</h2>\nIf you have a hernia, I recommend talking with your primary care physician. Sometimes, a hernia can be more complicated than they seem. Individuals need expertise for this medical problem and it should not be taken lightly.",

    "Title": "Walking To Prevent Dementia",
    "Content": "We all start the new year with strong intentions, whether we call them goals, aspirations, mantras or reminders. The process of evaluating the past year to shape our future begins as soon as we turn over the calendar.\n\nMy aspiration for the new year involves slowing down into more intentionality. If you’ve read my work, I usually espouse a maxim by philosopher, Thich Nhat Hanh: <em>When you walk, only walk</em>. Simple instructions for our lives.\n\nIt turns out, researchers have other ideas about our walking and how gait can aid in not only simplifying our life but also in determining our cognitive functioning.\n<h2>Can gait analysis help our brains?</h2>\nMitzi Gonzales, Ph.D., ABPP-CN, a neuropsychologist at Glenn Biggs Institute for Alzheimer’s and Neurodegenerative Diseases at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, shared in <a href=\"https://news.uthscsa.edu/walking-analysis-may-help-prevent-or-delay-dementia-symptoms/\">an article by UT Health San Antonio</a> that changes in how a person walks could help detect and distinguish different types of dementia. This is most evident when a patient is asked to walk while simultaneously solving a problem.\n\nThere is a study underway to find out how the gait of someone living with Lewy body dementia might be different from the gait of someone living with Alzheimer’s. Though the study must also consider the effects of past injuries, scientists plan to use technology to create a gait map of the participants’ walking strides.\n\nHere, the Thich Nhat Hanh’s suggestion might pay off for those of us concerned about the brain-body connection. Following an injury to my knee, I’ve had issues that consistently force me to evaluate and readjust how I step and walk.\n\n“Typically, some people see trade-off costs in the fact that their gait gets a little slower when they are performing a task such as subtracting by threes,” Gonzales said in the interview with UT Health San Antonio. “But in individuals living with a neurodegenerative disorder, we see more pronounced changes and that’s what we are interested in looking into further.”\n\nLuckily, what I try to do most while walking is walk or take photos with my phone. Math is not a problem I am trying to solve, especially while out in the city. However, I appreciate where the research is headed. Walking not only takes us outside but keeps us independent. Scientists will soon have the knowledge on how we can put into practice better habits when we stride.\n<h2>Counting Our Steps</h2>\nBy now, most of us possess or know someone who owns a smartwatch to track steps throughout the course of the day. My husband works on his feet all day. The average amount of steps he takes during a normal workday is 8,500, which could possibly be higher because he tends to take the stairs. As a writer, I must force myself to walk around the house, outdoors and will often go to the library if not for a book, then for a jaunt. I’d love to see a study published on the average number of words written per day to stave off dementia. For now, thanks to new research, I will count my steps.\n\nIn a <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2795819\">study published in <em>JAMA Neurology </em>in September 2022</a>, over 75,000 healthy people aged 40-79 who wore fitness trackers all day for at least three days logged their walking steps for seven years. Those who walked about 9,800 steps per day (about five miles) were 51% less likely to develop dementia. Even if one cut their steps to 3,800, there was still a 25% decrease in the likelihood of developing dementia. Though one should note, these results were from a purely observational study with plans for more detailed research.\n\nIf that number of steps proves too daunting, try the “Teabag walk.” In <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/379/bmj-2022-072833\">the Christmas 2022 issue of British Medical Journal</a>, scientists published a study that proved 11 minutes of inefficiently walking, like the John Cleese character in Monty Python’s “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCLp7zodUiI\">Ministry of Silly Walks</a>,” will benefit our health. The Teabag walk proved to significantly increase energy expenditure – about two and a half times the energy used in a normal walking gait.\n\nI’ve tried the Teabag walk several times and can confirm my heart rate did soar, while my tight hamstrings did not allow for maximum strides. However, I did provide a load of entertainment for city drivers when I attempted to be silly, which is also a healthy approach for the new year.\n\n<strong>Annette Januzzi Wick</strong> is a writer, speaker, and author of <em>I’ll Have Some of Yours, </em>a journey of cookies and caregiving<em> (Three Arch Press)</em>.

    "Title": "Venous Insufficiency: Prevention, Symptoms and Treatment",
    "Content": "Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as chronic venous disease, is a condition that causes blood to pool in the legs. This can happen if the valves that return blood back to the heart don’t work correctly due to their structure. Valves can also stop working correctly due to damage from a previous blood clot, a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/deep-vein-thrombosis\">deep vein thrombosis (DVT</a>) or another injury or trauma.\n\nStudies completed across the world have concluded that an estimated one-third of adults are affected by venous insufficiency – with many of those cases left untreated.\n<h2>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h2>\nAlthough women are more likely to experience venous insufficiency, men may develop it as well. Your risk of developing venous insufficiency increases with age, if you have a family history of the condition, are pregnant or have had multiple pregnancies, are a smoker or are obese. Symptoms of venous insufficiency include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Leg heaviness or fatigue.</li>\n \t<li>Leg swelling.</li>\n \t<li>Leg aching or cramping.</li>\n \t<li><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/varicose-veins-and-spider-veins\">Dilated varicose or spider veins</a>.</li>\n \t<li>Wounds or ulcers on the legs, especially around the ankle region.</li>\n</ul>\n“The more worrisome symptom is wound development,” shares <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/kate-gates-do-vascular-surgery\">Kate Gates, DO</a>, a vascular surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/vascular-care/vascular-institute\">Jobst Vascular Institute</a>. “These wounds develop due to the increased pressure that builds up in the vein system. The pressure changes the composition of the skin tissue and then makes it harder for the wounds to heal, therefore increasing the risk of infection.”\n\nIn addition to the physical symptoms of venous insufficiency, studies have demonstrated that patients with this disease report poorer quality of life, limitation of activities of daily living, feelings of low self-esteem and increased prevalence of depression. All of this emphasizes that this disease goes beyond cosmetic complications and contributes to the increased social isolation of those with venous insufficiency.\n\nDr. Gates explains that the earlier you are able to see a doctor, the better. “If you are experiencing any leg swelling, heaviness, fatigue or wounds, it’s definitely a good time to be evaluated. A vascular specialist will be able to determine the cause of your symptoms and determine if there is anything that they can do to help treat the condition.”\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\nTypically, non-invasive treatments to help improve blood flow are recommended first. These may include wearing compression stockings, keeping your legs elevated and exercising regularly.\n\nIf your symptoms do not improve or additional treatment is necessary, your doctor may recommend a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/varicose-veins-and-spider-veins#treatment\">minimally-invasive procedure</a> to treat the vein(s) with the faulty valve that is causing the blood pooling.\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\nVenous insufficiency often occurs in individuals that sit or stand for long periods of time. To prevent this, do your best to alternate between sitting and standing throughout your day.\n\nIf you have a family history of venous insufficiency, dilated veins or your occupation requires you to sit or stand for long periods of time without breaks, Dr. Gates recommends that you wear compression stockings throughout your day. Even if you are not experiencing symptoms of venous insufficiency or varicose veins, this may prevent the condition from developing in the first place. Additionally, exercising on a regular basis can be helpful for prevention.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong><em>Sources</em></strong>\n\nEvans, C. J., Fowkes, F. G., Ruckley, C. V., &amp; Lee, A. J. (1999).

    "Title": "Symptoms, Causes and Treatment of Eczema",
    "Content": "Red, itchy, dry skin? It could be eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis.\n<h2>What is eczema?</h2>\n“Eczema is a chronic skin condition that causes itchy, inflamed skin,” Avram Derrow, MD, allergy and immunology provider with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/avram-derrow-md-allergy-and-immunology\">ProMedica Physicians Allergy and Immunology - Maumee</a> explains.\n\nChildren and adults alike may experience this condition. If presents itself in the form of dry, itchy, irritated patches on the skin. Patches may be widespread across the body in children. Generally, as patients enter adulthood, eczema is contained to more localized areas such as elbows, knees or around the eyes.\n<h2>What are the symptoms of eczema?</h2>\nIn addition to the external symptoms of eczema (dry, itchy, irritated skin), individuals may experience sleeplessness due to discomfort, emotional distress or infection.\n\nAlthough not believed to be caused by eczema, individuals who experience eczema often also have asthma and/or seasonal, environmental or food allergies.\n<h2>What causes eczema?</h2>\nExactly what causes eczema is not fully understood and may be different for each person. However, it is believed that genetics and environmental factors play a role. “Individuals who have eczema may also have a deficiency in the protein filaggrin, which may cause a breakdown in the skin’s integrity,” Dr. Derrow shares.\n<h2>How is eczema treated?</h2>\nSome people may be able to resolve their eczema without seeing a physician or obtaining a prescription. Follow these steps to try treating eczema on your own:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Break the “itch-scratch” cycle.</strong> “Scratching will only make eczema worse,” Dr. Derrow shares. “Break the cycle by moisturizing and using medications that help reduce inflammation and dryness.”</li>\n \t<li><strong>Purchase an over-the-counter moisturizing cream.</strong> Find a hydrating cream. “Look for a moisturizer that comes in a tub rather than a pump container. Some moisturizers that come in a pump can actually dehydrate the skin,” Dr. Derrow shares.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Avoid harsh soaps and cleansers.</strong> Certain soaps and cleansers may be an irritant to your skin. Use gentle soaps and cleansers to help keep eczema flare-ups at bay.</li>\n</ul>\nIf your symptoms don’t improve, talk to your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">primary care provider</a>. They will be able to recommend a treatment plan for you that may include an anti-inflammatory prescription, steroids, biological medication in the form of injections or pills, and/or referral to a dermatologist or <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/allergies\">allergy/immunology specialist</a>.\n<h2>Is eczema curable?</h2>\nEczema is a chronic condition that does not have a cure. Long-term management of symptoms is necessary. Treatments can help maintain the integrity of your skin, reduce visible symptoms and improve comfort.",

    "Title": "The Tradition of Tea and Dementia",
    "Content": "During a particularly windy evening in southern Louisiana, my husband and I visited with our adult children. My stepdaughter asked if we’d like some tea. She moved toward the cabinet and called out an overwhelming selection of tea: fennel, caramel, green, etc. My stepdaughter is in her mid-thirties. When I was her age, I recall sipping on wine more than tea.\n\nDrinking tea has come into popularity again with the younger generation. All three of my stepdaughters enjoy holding a warm cup of tea in cold hands. Whereas coffee signifies a speeding up in our lives, tea signals a pause, helping us slow down while keeping our cognitive functioning intact.\n<h2>Studies on Tea Consumption</h2>\nHeadlines regularly report the health benefits of drinking tea. According <a href=\"https://www.ecu.edu.au/newsroom/articles/research/put-the-kettle-on-how-black-tea-and-other-favourites-may-help-your-health-later-in-life\">to research done by Edith Cowan University in November of 2022</a>, studies showed tea may be even better for us than previously thought.\n\nWithin a group of 881 elderly women, researchers found the women were less likely to have a buildup of calcification in their arteries, which leads to cognitive decline, if they consumed more flavonoids in their diet.\n\nWhy are flavonoids important? Foods high in flavonoids, such as black tea and blueberries, are known to have anti-inflammatory properties and protect cells from damage which often leads to diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer and cognitive diseases like Alzheimer's and dementia.\n\nIn using black tea as one of the main components of flavonoids in the study, they found that regular tea drinkers who drink two to six cups of tea per day were 16-42% less likely to have extensive calcification in their arteries; drawing the conclusion that more tea drinking leads to less cognitive challenges.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-022-01923-z#author-information\">Another study published on Nature.com in 2022</a>, reported similar results in a country well-known for its tea habits. Among a cohort of 337 participants, over the course of nine years, the UK Biobank found that drinking one to six cups of tea per day decreased the risk of developing dementia by 16%.\n\nOther indicators showed that tea benefited middle-aged or male participants even more.  Overall, findings proved that drinking one extra cup of tea per day (within a three-cup per day maximum) results in a 6% less chance of developing dementia.\n\n“In conclusion, moderate consumption of tea was significantly associated with a reduced risk of dementia,” the study shares.  This implies that modifying our tea consumption may help modify our dementia risks.\n<h2>Tea as a Ritual</h2>\nIf you’ve watched <em>The Crown</em>, you know there’s a certain way Brits like to make their tea. The custom of making and serving tea is a ritual in many cultures, including those with British roots, such as India. It’s also plentiful in Asian cultures. For instance, in Japan, ritual tea drinking originated from Zen monks who drank tea to keep awake during long sessions of meditation. It later became an active part of the Zen ritual to honor their patriarch, Bodhidharma. While Americans are not all practitioners of meditation, the need to slow down is imperative, and tea fits the bill for setting the pace for self-care.\n\nWhat does this pause allow us to do? To create a sense of mindfulness. To clear our heads of the detritus of our lives and focus on the present moment, whether it be a visit from the royal family or the latest bestseller.\n\nSometimes, it is the flavors, scents of lavender, rosehips, orange zest or almond, which settle into our consciousness and create this state of calm. Sometimes, it is the process of boiling, brewing, steeping and stirring, causing us to break away from our fast-paced rhythms.\n\nMost of us in the United States experience some kind of winter, whether it’s snow, rain, wind, or simply lower temperatures. While my husband and I often say there’s nowhere safe to travel in the U.S. during wintertime because there’s always a risk of unseasonably cold temperatures, we do know wherever we are, a steaming mug of tea can overcome the chill.\n\n<strong>Annette Januzzi Wick</strong> is a writer, speaker and author of <em>I’ll Have Some of Yours, </em>a journey of cookies and caregiving.<em> (Three Arch Press)</em>.

    "Title": "What To Do If You Get the Flu",
    "Content": "It’s officially peak flu season and many of us are experiencing the side effects. ProMedica family and sports medicine physician <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-rennels-do-family-medicine\">Matthew Rennels, DO,</a> talks about the symptoms and treatment of the flu, and what you can do to help avoid contracting the virus in the first place.\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\nThe flu is a respiratory tract infection that can affect your whole body. It usually starts abruptly with fever, tiredness, headache, muscle aches, sore throat and a cough. Many illnesses begin with flu-like symptoms, so it can be hard to determine if it’s the influenza virus that caused you to be sick.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you cannot tell the difference between the flu and COVID-19 by symptoms alone. A test is necessary to determine whether it is the flu, COVID-19 or another illness.\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\nIf you think you may have the flu, Dr. Rennels recommends avoiding hospital or emergency care treatment unless medically necessary. “I recommend that patients talk with their <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/patient-resources/find-a-doctor/default.aspx\">primary care provider</a> to get a recommendation on where to go. Use <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/pages/medical-services/urgent-care/default.aspx\">urgent care</a> if needed and, if that’s not available, then go to the emergency room if absolutely necessary. Your primary care provider should be able to direct you to the best place for the symptoms you have.”\n\nTreatment for the flu depends on your symptoms and other factors, including your overall health and any other health conditions that could make the sickness more severe. Rest and increased fluids are important and certain medicines may help relieve you of symptoms such as congestion, aches and fever.\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\nDr. Rennels says flu season may last through the end of February or even into March, depending on the weather, as the flu virus is most easily passed around in the colder weather.\n\nTo avoid contracting or spreading the flu, wash your hands well and often, and keep them away from your eyes, nose and mouth. Don’t share personal items such as drinking cups or toothbrushes. A person with the flu can spread the virus from the first day (before having symptoms) to up to seven days after becoming sick.\n\nFinally, it’s not too late to get the flu and COVID-19 shots, which reduces your risk of contracting the viruses. Contact your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/Pages/patient-resources/find-a-doctor/default.aspx\">primary care provider</a> to schedule your vaccination.",

    "Content": "Shoulder injuries can happen to anyone. Thankfully, most shoulder injuries can be treated with a little bit of rest. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-rennels-do-family-medicine\">Matthew Rennels, DO</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/sports-medicine\">ProMedica Sports Medicine Institute</a>, shares more about shoulder injuries and what you should do if you experience one.\n\n“The shoulder is one of the more mobile joints in the body, and because of that, it has a lot of moving parts. So, any small disturbance to the joint can cause a lot of dysfunction and pain,” Dr. Rennels shares.\n\nStaying active, keeping proper posture and monitoring for any signs that may limit your ability to use the joint to its full ability are all ways to help prevent a shoulder injury from happening.\n<h2>How To Alleviate Shoulder Pain</h2>\n“Rest your shoulder, and if there is a particular activity that is causing shoulder pain, avoid that activity,” Dr. Rennels advises. Icing the area that is painful and taking over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications can also help ease the pain.\n\nIf you experience decreased range of motion, weakness or severe pain, you should see a provider sooner rather than later so that they can diagnose the issue. Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician, sports medicine or orthopaedic specialist, or visit an urgent care to have your injury further evaluated.\n\nLearn more about shoulder injuries and treatment in the video, below.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLmGWQ-y9kA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "Title": "Understanding Prediabetes",
    "Content": "According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than one in three or 96 million people in the United States aged 18 or older have prediabetes.\n<h2>What is prediabetes?</h2>\nFor someone with prediabetes, their blood sugar levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be considered type 2 <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/diabetes\">diabetes</a>.\n\nWhen we eat our body breaks down food and turns it into glucose – or “sugar”. Our blood distributes the sugar to our muscles, tissues and cells to give our body energy. With prediabetes, and in type 2 diabetes, this process does not work the way it’s supposed to.\n\nWhen the sugar content in the bloodstream increases, the pancreas creates insulin. Insulin helps the body take in sugar from the blood and move the sugar along to where it needs to go in the body. When a person has prediabetes, the cells in the body do not always respond to the insulin. This is called insulin resistance. This insulin resistance leads to an increase in blood sugar levels, and is the foundational cause of prediabetes.\n\nAround 80% of those who are prediabetic do not know it because prediabetes generally does not have noticeable symptoms. In fact, many people do not have any symptoms until the prediabetes has already progressed to type 2 diabetes, and in turn has caused serious health problems, such as stroke and heart disease.\n\nFortunately, prediabetes is easy to diagnose. It takes a simple blood sugar test. Fasting blood sugar under 100 is normal, 100 to 125 is considered prediabetes, and fasting blood sugar 126 or above reflects actual diabetes.\n\nCommon risk factors for diabetes include being overweight, being 35 years or older, having a close family member with diabetes, and having a sedentary lifestyle. African Americans, Hispanic/Latino Americans, American Indians, Pacific Islanders and some Asian Americans are at a greater risk for developing prediabetes. It is important to talk with your primary care provider about your risk factors and how you can prevent prediabetes.\n<h2>Preventing Type 2 Diabetes</h2>\nPrediabetes becoming type 2 diabetes does not have to be a sure thing. With simple lifestyle changes, it is possible to prevent the progression of prediabetes to actual type 2 diabetes.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Lose a small amount of body weight.</strong> The CDC recommends those with prediabetes lose 5% to 7% of their total body weight.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get moving.</strong> Regular physical activity is important for overall health. Aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise a week. Even small things make a difference. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Park further away to increase the number of steps. And, do yardwork, gardening or other projects around the house. If watching TV or sitting for long periods of time at work, make a point to get up every 30 minutes to move around and stretch.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat a healthy diet.</strong> Cutting back on sugary foods and sweetened beverages can help to reduce your blood sugar levels. Aim for whole-grains, healthy proteins and plenty of vegetables.</li>\n</ul>\nMaking small changes can help to reduce your overall risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease and stroke. Consulting a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">doctor</a> is a great place to start if you are unsure where to begin.",

    "Title": "Breast Cancer Symptoms, Screenings and Risk Factors",
    "Content": "It’s likely that you or someone you know has a personal connection to breast cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, there are more than 3.8 million breast cancer survivors in the United States. That number includes those still being treated and those who have completed treatment. While that statistic may be shocking, it emphasizes the importance of early detection through routine screenings.\n<h2>Symptoms and Risk Factors</h2>\nMost women with breast cancer will not have any signs or symptoms when diagnosed. In these instances, an abnormality is detected on a screening mammogram. Other times, women may find a lump in their breasts during self-examination or accidentally during bathing. Lumps are often painless and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as nipple discharge, a sensation of fullness in the breast or a change in the way the breast looks. In rare instances, breast cancer may be identified after a woman presents with fullness, a mass or discomfort in the underarm area. It is important to note that not all breast lumps will be cancerous. It is best to consult a physician if any noticeable changes have occurred.\n\nSome risk factors for breast cancer are modifiable, while others are not. Age is the biggest risk factor, as most breast cancers are diagnosed after age 50. Other non-modifiable risk factors include family history in a first-degree relative, dense breast tissue on imaging, reproductive history and genetic mutations on specific genes.\n\nThere are plenty of things one can do to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer. It is recommended that women exercise regularly, avoid excessive alcohol consumption and maintain a healthy BMI after menopause. The most common demographic to be diagnosed with breast cancer is postmenopausal women.\n<h2>Screening Is Key</h2>\nMammograms are the single most important test that can be done to detect changes in the breast at the earliest stages. These changes can indicate underlying cancer or a benign but high-risk finding that can alert the physician that there may be a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer in the future. Mammograms are compared year to year to help detect changes in the breast tissue over time. These changes can also help to indicate underlying problems. Mammograms should be done annually, beginning at age 40 for women at average risk of breast cancer. Those with a higher risk may need screenings more frequently.\n\nIn addition to a mammogram, breast self-examinations can be performed in the shower when the skin may be smoother and, therefore, masses may be easier to feel. The standard recommendation is that breast self-examinations are to be performed monthly. It is also recommended that women look at their breasts in the mirror regularly while standing with hands on hips and extending arms overhead. One should note the contour of the breasts, how the nipples look and if there is any retraction in the skin or nipples. The most important thing is to identify what one’s “normal” is and note any changes from how things normally look and feel.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jessica-a-burns-md-breast-surgery\">Jessica Burns, MD</a>, is a fellowship-trained surgeon with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-physicians-breast-surgery\">ProMedica Physicians Breast Surgery</a>. </em><em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/breast-cancer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Learn more</a> about breast cancer screenings, diagnosis and treatments at ProMedica. </em>",

    "Title": "Recognizing Signs of Parkinson’s Disease in Friends and Family",
    "Content": "Muhammad Ali, the “greatest of all time (GOAT),” famous for his boxing prowess, in addition to his theatrical antics in and out of the ring, brought national attention to Parkinson’s disease when he was diagnosed after retirement. Despite the spotlight, the public often misses Parkinsonian symptoms by chalking them up to “old age.”\n\nSymptoms are mistakenly seen as a normal decline of once active and robust elders of the family and community. Yet, the disease is far from healthy aging. Recognizing the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease is important to catch and treat early so we can help give our loved ones a better quality of life.\n\nHere’s how to identify warning signs of Parkinson’s disease to help recognize potential cases.\n<h2>1. Rigidity</h2>\nAli once uttered the famous line “float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,” which commentators argued represented his fighting style: elegant, fast and powerful. In a sad twist of fate, Parkinson’s gave Ali rigidity, a stark contrast to his former agility.\n\nParkinsonian rigidity feels like a grapple; someone opposing and resisting your every movement. The rigidity has a variety of presentations in different people. It may occur in any joint – even the tiniest ones in the hand – or affect an entire extremity. Sometimes, the symptoms will be asymmetric – for example, it affects the right arm and left leg, but nowhere else in the body.\n<h2>2. Slowness, aka Bradykinesia</h2>\nWith mesmerizing speed and quick thinking, Ali was able to predict and dodge punches while launching effective counterattacks. In his older age, however, he began to slow down due to his Parkinson’s.\n\nSlowing down, aka bradykinesia, is a common finding in this disease. Patients feel like their movements and actions take more time to initiate and complete, like a sloth climbing along a tree branch. A patient may describe their experience as feeling weak, fatigued or uncoordinated. However, the real source of the issue is the inability to initiate movement. A disconnect seemingly exists between the brain and body where the former is commanding an action, but the latter is “slow” or unwilling to respond.\n<h2>3. Tremors</h2>\nAli’s punches were always smooth and efficient, connecting with his opponents and giving tremendous knockouts. Parkinson’s patients often develop tremors, which makes smooth movements almost impossible. Basic activities of daily life like eating cereal may become difficult as the uncontrollable shaking may launch milk and cereal pieces off the spoon. The ability to leave the house can be diminished as simple things like driving can become dangerous. The mundane and easy aspects of life may become more of a challenge. The tremors can also have a psychological burden as patients may feel ashamed and/or frustrated most with this symptom.\n<h2>4. Other Signs</h2>\nAs Parkinson’s progresses, patients often develop imbalance with standing or walking. The illness may limit or erase the ability for patients to keep upright, increasing the risk of falls and injuring themselves. Further progression of disease state can have a host of issues, including slowed cognition, hallucinations, depression and diminished emotional expressiveness.\n<h2>When To See a Doctor</h2>\nRecognizing these most common presentations of Parkinson’s disease will equip you to better identify the condition. Early intervention could improve a person’s day-to-day life and potentially slow their decline. If you think you or a loved one may be showing signs of Parkinson’s disease, talking with a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">primary care provider</a> is the first place to start. They will be able to assess and refer to a specialist if needed.",

    "Title": "How “Self-Care” Can Help Minimize Depression",
    "Content": "Your mental health is an important part of your well-being, and it’s important to check in with yourself from time to time. There are many aspects of mental health, but one of the most common mental health conditions that people experience is depression. Recognizing symptoms of depression is a first step in getting help and learning self-care strategies.\n<h2>Recognizing Depression</h2>\nEveryone feels down sometimes. But if you find yourself experiencing the following symptoms, you may be experiencing <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/depression\">depression</a>:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Avoiding people and activities you used to enjoy.</li>\n \t<li>Eating or sleeping too much or not enough.</li>\n \t<li>Feeling helpless or like nothing matters.</li>\n \t<li>Fighting with family and friends.</li>\n \t<li>Poor concentration.</li>\n \t<li>Low energy.</li>\n \t<li>Mood swings.</li>\n \t<li>Thoughts of suicide or self-harm.</li>\n \t<li>Unexplained aches and pains.</li>\n \t<li>Using alcohol, smoking or other drugs to cope.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you have been experiencing any of these symptoms for more than two weeks, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/alamdar-kazmi-md-psychiatry\">Alamdar Kazmi, MD,</a> ProMedica Physicians Behavioral Health – Sylvania, recommends talking with your primary care provider. Like many illnesses, clinical depression can be treated.\n\nWhen you talk with your doctor, they will ask about your symptoms, thoughts, feelings and behavior patterns to determine the best course of treatment. Treatment may include psychotherapy (talk therapy), pharmacotherapy (antidepressant medication), light therapy and/or alternative medicines. The best course of treatment is different for every person and depends on the patient’s preference or expectations, symptoms, other illnesses or medications, and their response to the therapies over time.\n\nDepression lasting more than two weeks that is affecting one’s quality of life or work performance can be helped with a combination of psychotherapy and medication. Notably, the benefits of psychotherapy often persist beyond the course of treatment, and patients remain well,” says Dr. Kazmi. “It is also important that patients pursue positive activities that may have ceased due to depression. Engaging in these activities is an effective means of relieving depression.”\n<h2>Self-Care Strategies</h2>\nEngaging in consistent self-care strategies can be beneficial, whether or not you have depression. Over time, self-care can help you build new routines that support your mental health. Try some of these proven self-care strategies:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Breathe.</strong> Take a moment to focus on your breathing. Count to four as you inhale, then count to four again as you exhale – repeat this several times. Calm your mind by taking these full, even breaths.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get some Zs.</strong> Your mind needs time to rest and recuperate each day. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night. Try your best to be consistent with the time that you wake up and go to bed each day, even on the weekends.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get moving</strong>! Exercising can reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression, and boost mood and self-esteem. Get your heart pumping faster than your resting rate for at least 30 minutes each day.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get outside</strong>. Even on cloudy days, spending time outside can help improve your mood, especially if you get outside within the first two hours of waking up in the morning.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Have fun with friends.</strong> Laughter produces a chemical that has anti-depressant and anti-anxiety effects.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Fuel your body with a balanced diet. </strong>A diet full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, eggs, beans and nuts can improve your happiness. Drinking water is always key!</li>\n \t<li><strong>Avoid smoking and drugs, and limit alcohol consumption. </strong>Tobacco, drugs and alcohol not only affect your physical health, but your mental health as well. Using substances as a coping mechanism is not effective and may make existing mental health conditions worse.</li>\n</ul>\nEveryone feels down sometimes. If your blues are constant and keep you from doing the things you love, talk to your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">primary care provider</a> for help.",

    "Title": "What Is Prostate Cancer and How To Prevent It",
    "Content": "According to the American Cancer Society, one in eight men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, just behind lung cancer. While these statistics may be shocking, it is important to mention that while prostate cancer is a serious disease, most men diagnosed and treated do not die from it. That’s why it is imperative to get regular prostate cancer screenings.\n<h2>What is prostate cancer?</h2>\nProstate cancer is a type of cancer that arises in the prostate gland, which is part of the male reproductive system. Most men with prostate cancer do not experience any symptoms. Usually, the cancer is found before symptoms arise due to routine screenings. Left untreated, prostate cancer can cause difficulty urinating, blood in urine or cancer spreading to the surrounding bones and lymph nodes, causing pain.\n\nThere are risk factors that can increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Age:</strong> The chance of being diagnosed with prostate cancer rapidly increases after age 50. Men under 40 are less likely to develop the cancer, but it is still possible in rare circumstances.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Race/ethnicity: </strong>Prostate cancer is more prevalent in Caribbean and African American men. Typically, when men of Caribbean or African descent develop prostate cancer, they tend to be younger than other ethnicities. Non-Hispanic white men are more at risk for prostate cancer than Asian American and Hispanic/Latino men.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Geography: </strong>North America, northwestern Europe, Caribbean islands and Australia have the highest incidents of prostate cancer.</li>\n \t<li>Family history – According to the American Cancer Society, having a father or brother with prostate cancer more than doubles a man’s risk of developing the disease.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\nWhile there isn’t a clear answer to what causes prostate cancer, a healthy diet can make a big difference in overall health. Avoid heavily processed foods and replace them with fruit, vegetables and lean meats. Lycopene, a carotenoid and antioxidant found in red-colored fruits and vegetables, like tomatoes, has been suggested in many studies to decrease the risk of prostate cancer.\n\nRoutine screenings are the best way to detect cancer at the early stages. It is generally recommended that men begin getting screened for prostate cancer beginning at age 50. However, if there is a first-degree relative with the disease or a strong family history, the recommended screening age may be lower. Prostate cancer can often be found early by testing a blood sample. Prostate cancer is a disease that commonly will not show any symptoms during the screening period when it is the most curable.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/prostate-cancer\">Learn more</a> about prostate cancer, treatments and screenings. </em>",

    "Title": "Young Adults with Sickle Cell Disease Need Extra Support",
    "Content": "Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. About 100,000 Americans are diagnosed with the disease, which can cause serious health problems. Access to health care is vital for these individuals, especially in early adulthood.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/crawford-j-strunk-md-pediatric-hematologyoncology\">Crawford Strunk, MD,</a> pediatric hematologist/oncologist, explains, “There’s a period from the ages of about 16-25 as patients are transitioning from pediatric care to adult care, that leaves them at a much higher risk for morbidity and mortality related to their disease. There’s a much higher incidence of death in that age group than there is at either side of that age group.”\n\nEnsuring that young adults with sickle cell disease get the care they need is vital to helping them live their healthiest, now and in the future.\n<h2>Understanding the Disease</h2>\nSickle cell disease is the most common form of an inherited blood disorder, and it impacts Black Americans at much higher rates. The disease changes red blood cells in the body from round and flexible to stiff, sticky and sickle-shaped. These cells can’t travel through blood vessels well and break down quickly.\n\nThe most common problems associated with sickle cell disease include anemia and blockage of the flow of blood in the tissues. It can cause swelling, pain and other complications. Over time, because of sickling of the red blood cells, patients can also develop chronic organ damage to almost any organ. Bone, kidney, lung and spleen are the most common sites of chronic damage.\n<h2>Managing the Life-long Condition</h2>\nSickle cell disease is typically diagnosed at birth through a routine blood test. There is no cure, but it can be treated. Children with the disease may need preventive therapy such as prophylactic antibiotics, immunizations and screening for stroke risk and other known complications.\n\nAs individuals reach adulthood, they may find it challenging to find health care to meet their needs. In fact, only a few adult sickle cell clinics exist nationally. Those clinics report reduced emergency center visits, hospitalizations, and a reduced rate of long-term complications for their patients.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people with sickle cell disease have less access to comprehensive team care than people with hemophilia and cystic fibrosis, even though sickle cell disease is more common.\n\n“Nationally, there are not a lot of medical providers with the experience or expertise to care for patients with sickle cell disease,” said Dr. Strunk. “It’s important to have a continuity of care as pediatric patients become adults. Their medical needs change and they are also glad to visit an adult office instead of a pediatric office in their 20s.”\n<h2>ProMedica’s Adult Clinic</h2>\nAdult clinics, such as the ProMedica Comprehensive Adult Sickle Cell Clinic, can address the unique issues of adults with sickle cell disease. This may include coordinating care under the direction of a hematologist, reviewing medications, providing maintenance infusion services and connecting patients to relevant social services.\n\nThe ProMedica Comprehensive Adult Sickle Cell Clinic opened in 2019 at ProMedica Toledo Hospital. It is the first adult-focused sickle cell clinic in northwest Ohio.\n\n“It’s really important for individuals of all ages to be able to access care at a comprehensive sickle cell center,” explains Dr. Strunk. “At our clinic, we get to know our patients and can help with ongoing care, as well as acute care needs.”\n\nThe ProMedica clinic accepts physician referrals as well as self-referrals from patients who would benefit from a comprehensive care setting.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/sickle-cell-disease\">Learn more</a> about sickle cell disease and ProMedica's Comprehensive Sickle Cell Clinics.</em>",

    "Title": "Strains vs. Sprains: What’s the Difference and How To Recover",
    "Content": "It can happen during a game of softball or by stumbling on the sidewalk. Strains and sprains are different injuries, but how can we know the difference and what can we do if we have a strain or sprain? <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/marshall-ochi-do-family-medicine\">Marshall Ochi, DO</a>, with <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/sports-medicine\">ProMedica Sports Medicine Institute</a>, shares the difference between a strain and a sprain and what you can do to treat them.\n<h2>Strains vs. Sprains</h2>\nA strain is an injury that occurs to a muscle or a tendon, whereas a sprain is an injury to a ligament. These are different because tendons link muscle to bone and ligaments link bone to bone. Sprains and strains can be equally uncomfortable and may even happen simultaneously.\n\n[row]\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]</span>\n<h2>Treatment</h2>\nRegardless of whether it’s a sprain or a strain, your best bet is to follow the acronym RICE:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>R</strong>est: Rest from exacerbating activities to prevent further injury.</li>\n \t<li><strong>I</strong>ce: Apply ice to injury for 15-20 minutes several times per day but as often as hourly immediately following the injury and while injury is still acute.</li>\n \t<li><strong>C</strong>ompression: Use and ACE wrap or compression sleeve to help decrease and prevent  further swelling. The wrap should be snug but not too tight to interrupt blood flow.</li>\n \t<li><strong>E</strong>levation: Keep the injured part of the body above the level of your heart when lying down.</li>\n</ul>\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<a href=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/RICE.png\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-8652\" src=\"https://promedicanewsnetwork.org/media/RICE.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"291\" height=\"291\" /></a>\n\n[/column]\n[/row]\n\n“If RICE therapy doesn’t significantly improve your symptoms over the course of the first day or two and you still have a significant reduction in your ability to do normal activities, the injury should be further accessed by a medical professional,” Dr. Ochi shares.\n\nSchedule an appointment with your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">primary care physician</a>, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=31&amp;SpecialtyText=Sports%20Medicine\">sports medicine</a> or <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=3&amp;SpecialtyText=Orthopaedic%20Surgery\">orthopaedic specialist</a>, or visit an <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-locations/location-results?LocationTypeId=35&amp;LocationTypeText=Urgent%20Care\">urgent care</a> to have your injury further evaluated. The provider will determine if additional testing is needed, such as an <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/x-ray\">X-ray</a> or <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/ultrasound\">ultrasound</a> to determine the severity or significance of the injury.\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\nRecovery time for strains and sprains varies from injury to injury. Some strains and minor sprains may be better within days, some may take a couple of weeks to be back to normal and some more severe sprains may take even longer.\n\nHelp prevent future injury by rehabbing the muscles, tendons and ligaments around your injury. “Focus on remaining active and strengthening the supporting structures surrounding the area that was injured,” Dr. Ochi shares. “Additionally, focus on increasing flexibility. Being limber can help to prevent future injury.”\n\nIt may take a while for you to get back to feeling 100%. In the meantime, continue RICE therapy by resting, icing, compressing and elevating your injury, and then begin stretching and strengthening once your symptoms allow.  If you are unsure if/when you should initiate the rehab exercises, talk to your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=5\">primary care physician</a>, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=31&amp;SpecialtyText=Sports%20Medicine\">sports medicine</a> or <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor/provider-results?SpecialtyId=3&amp;SpecialtyText=Orthopaedic%20Surgery\">orthopaedic specialist</a> for more guidance.",

    "Title": "Sports Concussions: Know the Signs",
    "Content": "Traumatic brain injuries are more common than one may think. One of the most common types of traumatic brain injury is a sports concussion. A sports concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury that usually occurs due to some sort of force acting on the head or neck. It causes microscopic injury to the brain. A sports concussion can affect any athlete, from a little league to a professional player.\n\nAccording to the Journal of Athletic Training, of all the sports, women’s soccer was found to have the highest injury rate of concussions. This can be linked to the fact that soccer is an aggressive sport, and protective headgear is not required while playing. Sports concussions also commonly occur in high-contact sports such as football, rugby, lacrosse and basketball.\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>\nSigns and symptoms of a sports concussion include headache, nausea, dizziness and confusion. Some may experience more severe symptoms such as vomiting and difficulty sleeping. Some may exhibit increased emotions immediately following a sports concussion. They may become suddenly upset and lose the ability to control their emotions on the field. In the days following injury, one may experience headache, fatigue, irritability and sensitivity to light and noise.\n\nOften, a sports concussion goes undiagnosed. If one suspects they have a sports concussion, they most likely do, and it is recommended to seek medical attention. A diagnosis can be made by describing symptoms and the event to a healthcare provider. While in medical care, the athlete also will undergo a full neurological and physical evaluation to ensure no further injuries are present.\n<h2>Recovery</h2>\nIf an athlete does not remove themselves from the game after experiencing a head injury, there is an increased risk of other orthopaedic injuries that may take longer to heal. There is a common myth about not allowing someone to sleep after a concussion; this is simply not true. One should sleep to allow the brain to rest, heal and repair itself. Athletes should not return to activity until after they have followed up with a healthcare provider who determines that they have properly recovered.\n<h2>Minimizing Risk</h2>\nMinimize the risk of a sports concussion by wearing the recommended protective equipment and following the rules of the game, as these rules are created to protect participants from injury and keep them safe. Also, staying on top of one’s health, getting enough sleep, eating well, and staying hydrated will help all players to perform at their best both mentally and physically.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/erica-martin-md-family-medicine\">Erica Martin, MD,</a> is with ProMedica Physicians Family Medicine | Sports Medicine. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/sports-medicine#prevention\">Learn more</a> about concussions and other sports medicine services and conditions. </em>",

    "Title": "Managing Allergies and Asthma with Natural Lung Support",
    "Content": "Time spent outside is good for our overall health. Studies have shown that time in nature can help improve our mood and even support our immune system. Warmer seasons may bring longer days and welcome sunshine, but can also increase the symptoms of lung issues, such as allergies and asthma. Fortunately, there are some simple and natural things you can do to help the sniffling, sneezing and wheezing you may be experiencing.\n<h2>Wash Away the Allergens</h2>\nOur clothing can collect allergens and irritants such as pollen, which can aggravate allergy symptoms even once you’re indoors. Changing clothes once you come in from an outdoor activity can stop you from carrying allergens like pollen and grass on your body. These same allergens can also get into our nasal passages and irritate tissues in the nose, which could lead to more sneezing and runny nose.\n\nJust like we wash off and clean our skin, our nasal passages can also be washed with the use of a neti pot. A neti pot is a teapot-like device that uses warm salt water to gently rinse out any allergens trapped in nasal passages and sinuses. Nasal washes like the neti pot have been used for hundreds of years and there are now newer styles shaped like plastic squeeze bottles that are simple to use.\n<h2>Keep It Soothed</h2>\nNasal passages, eyes, mouth and throat can all become scratchy, dry and irritated after exposure to allergens. Lubricating eye drops can help calm red and dry eyes. This can often be used several times a day to help keep dryness symptoms maintained. Try to resist the urge to rub dry eyes as to not cause any damage to the eyes and make sure to wash hands before touching the eye area. For nasal passages, natural saline-based (i.e., salt water-based) sprays may help keep the passages from being dry. Dry nasal passages could be more sensitive to exposure to allergens, so keeping the nose hydrated could help it feel less irritated.\n\nScratchy throat and a dry feeling in the mouth and throat can also be common symptoms of allergies. Hydrating mouth lozenges can provide some relief throughout the day from the dryness and drinking tea can help soothe an irritated throat. Look for products that contain hyluaronic acid, which can help keep moisture in the mouth and throat area to ease dryness. Also, herbs like marshmallow root and slippery elm create a soothing coating on the throat when sipped in a tea.\n<h2>Keep It Sweet with Local Honey</h2>\nHoney is sweet and delicious, but did you know that it also could have some health benefits? When purchasing honey, look for one that is locally sourced. Honey is made by bees that feast on the pollen found in the flowers around them. Local honey contains very small amounts of the pollen found in the area. It is thought that consuming honey with these traces of local pollen could help your body adjust to the pollen in your environment. This could ease allergy symptoms by getting your body used to the pollen in the area so you may not have as much of an allergy reaction to them. Honey can be stirred into tea, spread on toast or eaten right off the spoon.\n<h2>Try Cupping</h2>\n<a href=\"https://promedicanaturalwellnessshop.com/services/#cupping\">Cupping</a> is a modality that has been around for centuries. You may be familiar with how the technique leaves circle marks on the skin and how it’s commonly used to relax tight muscles. But did you know that there are other uses for cupping? Cupping can help open the diaphragm and support the lungs, which could be helpful for those with asthma, wheezing and other lung concerns.\n\n<em>Be sure to contact your healthcare provider before trying any new natural product.

    "Title": "How Complementary Medicine Could Benefit Your Cancer Care Plan",
    "Content": "Many cancer patients experience side effects related to their cancer treatment. Nausea, vomiting and fatigue are just a few of the additional challenges they may face. If you’re currently undergoing cancer care and experiencing unpleasant side effects, complementary medicine may be a great addition to your cancer care plan.\n<h2>What are the benefits of complementary medicine?</h2>\nComplementary medicine uses products, practices and therapies in tandem with standard medical care, but not in place of standard medicine. An example is using relaxation and imagery along with prescribed medications to reduce nausea and vomiting.\n\nCancer patients and survivors may utilize complementary medicine to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cope with side effects of cancer treatments, such as nausea, pain and tiredness.</li>\n \t<li>Manage stress from cancer and cancer treatments.</li>\n \t<li>Take an active role in their cancer care.</li>\n \t<li>Improve their overall health.</li>\n</ul>\nDeb Reis, RN, MSN, coordinator of the ProMedica Cancer Institute Healing Care Program, speaks to the benefits of complementary medicine practices. “Complementary therapies go beyond cancer treatment and help us treat the physical, mental and spiritual aspects of a patient,” Reis shares. “Oftentimes, when a patient receives a cancer diagnosis, they feel out of control. Complementary therapies are a tool they can use to regain some sense of balance and take control of an aspect of their care plan.”\n<h2>Using Complementary Medicine</h2>\nComplementary medicine should always be used under the guidance of a medical professional. It’s important to remember that while some complementary therapies such as acupuncture, yoga, meditation, relaxation and imagery have been researched and have been found to be safe and helpful, other therapies may not work, may be harmful, or could interact negatively with your other treatments or medicines. Always talk to your doctor, nurse and/or pharmacist before taking any herbs, supplements or vitamins to make sure there are no foreseen adverse reactions with your other treatments.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/cancer-survivorship#survivorship\">ProMedica Cancer Institute Healing Care Program</a> is designed to help cancer patients on their journey to health during and after cancer treatment. Classes and one-on-one sessions are free to individuals who are receiving cancer care at ProMedica. Cancer patients, survivors and their family members may take advantage of the program during their treatment and for two years after their last treatment date. The program includes therapies such as relaxation and meditation, guided imagery, aromatherapy, healing touch, relaxing music and sleep tips. For more information or to schedule an appointment, call <a href=\"tel:+1-419-824-5538\">419-824-5538</a>.\n\nThe <a href=\"https://promedicanaturalwellnessshop.com/\">ProMedica Natural Wellness Shop </a>carries a wide selection of complementary medicine products such as vitamins, holistic items, and supplements. The shop also offers complementary medicine services provided by a licensed acupuncturist and natural wellness practitioner, including\n<ul>\n \t<li>Auricular therapy, which stimulates pressure points in the ear to help with problems such as nausea and pain.</li>\n \t<li>Cupping, where glass cups are applied to the skin to help energy flow.</li>\n</ul>\nTalk with your <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/promedica-cancer-institute/\">cancer care team</a> to learn more about complementary therapies and medicines that could be helpful for you.",

    "Title": "The Difference Between Mental Health and Mental Illness",
    "Content": "Most people will experience a mental health challenge at some point in their life. Stressors from the pandemic, current world affairs and social media among other things can contribute to periods of poor mental health. But at what point does poor mental health become mental illness?\n<h2>Mental Health Versus Mental Illness</h2>\nAlthough often used interchangeably, mental health and mental illness are different. Mental health includes a person’s overall emotional, social and psychological well-being. It can affect the way one acts, thinks and feels. Everyone has mental health, but not every person will experience mental illness.\n\nWhen a difficult situation or stressors occur, it is easy to fall into a period of poor mental health. That is why it is important to know the proper steps to take to get back on track. Adequate rest, exercise, a healthy diet, drugs and alcohol avoidance, physical health and spiritual well-being can all play a factor in increasing overall mental health.\n\nMental illness, or mental health disorder, refers to a wide range of disorders that can affect mood, thinking, feeling and behavior. Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 50% of people will be diagnosed with a mental illness or disorder at some point in their life.\n\nWhile there are several different mental health disorders, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder are some of the most commonly diagnosed.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Bipolar disorder</strong> is a brain disorder that causes changes in a person’s mood, energy and ability to function. Individuals with bipolar disorder could have intense emotional states that typically occur from weeks to days with abnormally happy or irritable moods.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Major depressive disorder</strong> is characterized by low mood, lack of energy, changes in appetite with weight loss or gain, trouble sleeping or sleeping too much, increased fatigue, feeling worthless, loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed, difficulty concentrating, and recurrence of suicidal thoughts.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> is most commonly associated with excessive ongoing worry and tension, unrealistic views of problems, restlessness or a feeling of being edgy, trouble concentrating, trouble sleeping, and muscle tension or muscle aches.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Know When to Seek Help</h2>\nThere are many signs and symptoms that come with mental illness, depending on the type of illness one has. The most common symptoms to look for are feelings of depression, anxiety, mood swings, irritability, lack of sleep and appetite, tiredness, delusions, paranoia, suicidal thoughts and inability to function normally. However, symptoms will vary from person to person.\n\nIt is important to promptly seek help when needed. If one does not know where to start, contacting a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/primary-care?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=AlwaysOnSearch-QS&amp;utm_term=2022&amp;utm_content=PCP&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw-8qVBhANEiwAfjXLrqTpRafEC8mLp3epWFtKJLvj-9Tw-1xZXMcwTMfKbFRltPCQbA_0shoC13AQAvD_BwE#providers\">primary care provider</a> can provide next steps to getting help. If an individual is having suicidal thoughts, it is important to contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline immediately at 800-273-8255. Do not be ashamed to talk about mental health, especially to a behavioral health professional, close friend or family member.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/thomas-osinowo-md-psychiatry\">Thomas Osinowo, MD,</a> is a psychiatrist with ProMedica Behavioral Health - Monroe.</em>",

Common symptoms of PAD include leg pain that is often relieved by rest, cold feet or pain in the feet. These symptoms are a result of insufficient blood flow due to a buildup of plaque in the arteries.\n\nEarly intervention is key, as untreated PAD can lead to painful symptoms, loss of a leg, and an increased risk of coronary artery disease, stroke and heart attack.\n\nDr. Aplin discusses more about PAD, including its symptoms, causes and treatment, in this video.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/By4BRrTsXXk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Could you be at risk for PAD?

    "Title": "Understanding and Managing Sickle Cell Disease",
    "Content": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common single-gene disorder in the world. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that in the United States, SCD occurs among one out of every 365 Black or African-American births and one out of every 16,300 Hispanic-American births.\n\nSCD is a disorder of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen. As oxygen is released from the hemoglobin in the red blood cells, the hemoglobin changes shape into a deoxygenated, or sickled shape.\n\nOnce the cells become sickle shaped, there can be damage to the red blood cell, causing it to burst. This can lead to irritation of the blood vessel lining. Sickled cells can also cause activation of the white blood cells and platelets, which causes stickiness that can block the blood flow in the vessels, leading to the pain normally associated with SCD. Not only can the sickling of the red blood cells cause pain, but it can also cause acute problems and chronic organ damage.\n\nPeople with SCD start to show signs and symptoms around five months of age. Infants do not usually show signs because fetal hemoglobin protects the cells from sickling.\n\nPeople who only inherit one sickle cell gene from their parents have sickle cell trait (SCT). SCT carriers usually do not have symptoms of SCD, but they can pass the trait on to their children. According to the CDC, if only one parent has SCT, there is a 50% chance that the child will inherit SCT. If both parents have SCT, the child has a 25% chance of having SCD.\n<h2>Living with Sickle Cell Disease</h2>\nPeople with SCD can live a full, active life. While someone with SCD may not be able to control how it affects them entirely, some things can help with managing symptoms.\n<ul>\n \t<li>The<strong> severity of pain </strong>associated with sickle cell disease can vary from person to person. Discussing symptoms with a physician, looking for pain triggers, pain medications and relaxation techniques can help relieve and manage pain.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Take medication. </strong>Take prescribed medication as directed by a physician.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stay up to date with vaccinations </strong>to prevent serious infections. People with sickle cell disease are encouraged to get the annual flu shot, and the pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines. Common illnesses can quickly become dangerous if living with sickle cell disease.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Drink enough fluids.</strong> It is important to have proper hydration to prevent a sickle cell crisis. When exercising or in a humid environment, more water will need to be consumed.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat healthy foods and get enough sleep. </strong>Sleep for at least eight hours a night and consume a diet of whole grains, protein, fruits and vegetables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>How To Help a Loved One</h2>\nSupporting a loved one with SCD can make all the difference. Taking a person with SCD at their word is very important. If they say they are in pain, they are in pain. There is no clinical marker or test that can determine if a person is in pain or not, which makes it extremely important to believe them and treat them appropriately.\n\nMany people with SCD often feel alone in their illness. In providing a support system, it is vital to be an active listener and acknowledge their pain is real. Clinical teams also play a role in providing support by helping to manage pain and provide additional resources.\n\n<em>Learn more about sickle cell treatment options for <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-comprehensive-pediatric-sickle-cell-clinic\">children</a> and <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-comprehensive-adult-sickle-cell-clinic\">adults</a> at ProMedica.</em>",

    "Title": "When is memory loss actually Alzheimer’s?",
    "Content": "As we age, we forget things. It’s a natural part of life. Yet, sometimes we worry that memory loss is a sign of something more serious, like dementia.\n\nAlzheimer’s is the most common type of dementia, but it’s not the only cause of memory loss. Other types of dementia include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Vascular dementia.</strong> Often related to stroke, it affects the ability to make decisions, plan or organize.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Lewy body dementia (LBD).</strong> LBD causes symptoms similar to Alzheimer’s, along with sleep disturbances, hallucinations and muscle rigidity.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Frontotemporal dementia (FTD).</strong> FTD leads to changes in personality and behavior, and trouble with language.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Alzheimer’s?</h2>\nOver time, we all lose nerve cells that help our brains function. But people with Alzheimer’s lose far more cells due to clusters of protein that attach to nerve cells and cause damage.\n\nOlder people are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, but we don’t yet know why some have it and others don’t.\n<h2>How do I know if my loved one may have Alzheimer’s?</h2>\nAlzheimer’s symptoms begin with memory loss, but progress to confusion and the inability to perform daily tasks. Talk to your doctor if your loved one:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Is confused about day and time.</li>\n \t<li>Can’t remember recent events.</li>\n \t<li>Has trouble focusing on tasks.</li>\n \t<li>Has trouble doing things that usually come easily.</li>\n \t<li>Doesn’t recognize family or friends.</li>\n \t<li>Has trouble communicating or finding words.</li>\n \t<li>Has mood swings.</li>\n \t<li>Gets lost easily.</li>\n \t<li>Becomes clumsy or uncoordinated.</li>\n</ul>\nThe Alzheimer’s Association provides this <a href=\"http://www.alz.org/national/documents/checklist_10signs.pdf\">checklist</a> to record changes in mental alertness or abilities. You can complete it and take it to your loved one’s doctor’s appointment.\n<h2>How do I support a loved one who has Alzheimer’s?</h2>\nDealing with Alzheimer’s can be overwhelming. Stop. Take a deep breath. With the right tools and a little help, you can face it head on.\n<h3>Be Realistic</h3>\nIt can feel like Alzheimer’s robs our loved ones of their memories and their lives. Avoiding the issue might feel like a good way to reduce the emotional and physical stress it brings. But Alzheimer’s won’t go away. Empower yourself. Work with a care team to understand the disease and the care options. Together, you can find much-needed support.\n\nDon’t ignore the symptoms or delay talking to a doctor. Left untreated, this condition can lead to an accident or serious incident.\n<h3>Ask for Help</h3>\nCaring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s is a big responsibility, but you don’t have to do it alone. Ask your friends and family for help and call on other resources when you need them. Consider the following programs and services:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Support groups:</strong> Connect with others who share your challenges to get help, perspective and advice. Find a local or virtual support group through the <a href=\"https://www.alz.org/help-support/community/support-groups\">Alzheimer’s Association</a> or an <a href=\"http://www.arden-courts.com/locations/\">Arden Courts</a> memory care location near you.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Home care:</strong> Home visits from experienced home health care and hospice specialists may help your loved one in the comfort of their own environment.

    "Title": "What is ‘Pandemic Foot’?",
    "Content": "Nearly two years into the pandemic, many find themselves dealing with foot complications for the first time. While not an official or medical term, this phenomenon has been deemed “pandemic foot.\" “Pandemic foot” describes a variety of foot conditions believed to be caused by various direct and indirect factors relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhile it may take several years for official research-based data, podiatrists nationwide have been reporting a rise in these sorts of conditions. Injuries and conditions commonly seen include fragility fractures, fractures of the ankle, metatarsal or toe bones, as well as overuse injuries such as Achilles tendonitis or plantar fasciitis. Additionally, diabetes-related foot complications have seen a dramatic increase.\n\nMany of the factors contributing to “pandemic foot” are related to inactivity followed by increased activity, also known as “doing too much, too soon.” With prolonged inactivity, the body can undergo muscle atrophy, where the muscles waste away. Bones can also weaken at the same time. This can leave individuals more prone to fractures, tendonitis and sprains.\n\nSpending more time indoors during the pandemic can decrease our overall absorption and production of Vitamin D, which is obtained largely from sunlight. Vitamin D is essential for bone health, among other important bodily functions. Additionally, there has been a hesitancy to see physicians and specialists during the pandemic, which can cause issues to worsen overtime. Hospitals and medical facilities are safe, and patients should feel comfortable seeking all types of care.\n\nMuch of foot health is related to one’s overall health. There are various ways to protect oneself from becoming susceptible to “pandemic foot.\" Wearing supportive shoes outside and around the house will not only offer support but protect one’s feet in the event of a trip or fall. Get outside for at least 20-30 minutes per day to obtain the benefits of sunlight exposure, like Vitamin D. Now, more than ever, health and wellness should be an integral part of daily life for all. Daily physical activity or movement, adequate quality sleep and proper nutrition promote good foot health.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/matthew-reiner-dpm-facfas-podiatry\">Matthew Reiner, DPM, FACFAS,</a> is a podiatrist with ProMedica Physicians.</em>",

    "Title": "Reducing Your Spring and Summer Allergy Symptoms",
    "Content": "The return to spring is often a welcome change of seasons, but it can be challenging for those who live with diagnosed and undiagnosed allergies.\n\nAs plants begin to bloom, pollen is released into the air. The two biggest culprits at this time are trees and grass. In northwest Ohio, tree pollen allergies usually begin in March and last until the end of May. Grass pollen begins in early May and can last all summer. If it’s a particularly rainy spring and summer, there may be high counts of mold spores, which can also contribute to seasonal allergy issues.\n\nTypical symptoms include frequent sneezing, itchy or watery eyes, and a runny, stuffy or drippy nose.\n<h2>Lifestyle Changes</h2>\nFor those with allergies, lifestyle changes may help reduce exposure and symptoms. Here are some tips:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Keep your windows closed. </strong>Whether you’re driving with the windows down or enjoying the spring breeze throughout your house, the fresh air is an opportunity for outdoor pollen to agitate your allergies. Keep your windows closed and use air conditioning as needed.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Plan your time outside. </strong>If you exercise outdoors or like to garden, look at the pollen counts and plan your activities accordingly. A pollen count of ten or less is considered low, 10-100 is medium and above 100 is a high pollen count. Pollen counts are generally highest in the morning and in the late evening.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Wash the pollen away.</strong> When you come in from the outdoors, take off your shoes and jacket. Shower and wash your hair, particularly before going to bed, otherwise the pollen will stay on your clothes and bed.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Take your medications regularly.</strong> Children, in particular, may not always get their medications on a regular basis as parents may only give them medicine when the allergy symptoms are bad. If you know the allergy season has started and will go on for some time, give your child their medication on a daily basis to keep symptoms at bay.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Treatment Options</h2>\nIf seasonal allergies are affecting your quality of life, it’s time to talk with your primary care provider or specialist. A board-certified allergy specialist can help identify what you’re allergic to and look at all the treatment options.\n\nNon-sedating antihistamines are typically the first choice of medication given to people with allergies. For some, these may not be enough. Decongestants may be recommended, but because they may raise your blood pressure, they aren’t good to take long-term. Allergy eye drops are very effective and can also be used on an as-needed basis\n\nNasal steroid sprays may be effective with symptoms, including sneezing, itching, congestion and stuffiness. They also get to the area where you need the medication, without any systemic side effects. Using a nasal saline irrigations, such as a Neti Pot, a couple times a day may also help reduce symptoms.\n\nWhen these don’t work, allergy immunotherapy may be recommended to desensitize the immune system to tolerate the allergens. These can be done as allergy shots or under the tongue (sublingual) tablets for some allergies. The benefit of allergy immunotherapy is that it can help reduce allergy symptoms, decrease medication needs and improve quality of life.\n\n<em>Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/allergies\">allergy testing and treatment at ProMedica</a>.</em>",

    "Title": "Why Strokes Happen and How To Spot Them",
    "Content": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), someone in the United States has a stroke every 40 seconds, and every four minutes, a person dies from it. Learning about the signs of a stroke and what to do in an emergency can help you get immediate care for yourself or a loved one.\n<h2>Why do strokes happen?</h2>\nThe brain needs a constant supply of blood, which carries the oxygen and nutrients it needs to function. A stroke occurs when blood vessels that carry blood to the brain from the heart are either blocked or burst, causing a leak. As a result, part of the brain does not get the blood needed, and the tissue begins to die.\n\nThere are three types of strokes. The most common type is an ischemic stroke. It occurs when blood clots or other particles block or narrow the blood vessels to the brain, causing reduced blood flow. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel bursts in the brain, leading to leakage of blood. This can be caused by an array of factors such as trauma to the head and bulges at weak spots in blood vessel walls (aneurysms). Also known as a mini-stroke, a transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a brief interruption of blood flow caused by a clot or debris, often may be a warning sign of a future full-blown stroke. A TIA may only last a few minutes and typically does not cause permanent damage.\n<h2>What are the symptoms of a stroke?</h2>\nMen and women often feel similar symptoms of a stroke. Stroke symptoms can appear quickly, making early detection and medical attention imperative to lessen the chances of disability or even death. One helpful acronym to remember what to look for when someone is having a suspected stroke is <em>BE FAST</em>.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>B</strong>alance difficulties and dizziness.</li>\n \t<li><strong>E</strong>yesight changes (blurry or double vision).</li>\n \t<li><strong>F</strong>ace drooping or numbness (the smile may look uneven).</li>\n \t<li><strong>A</strong>rm weakness (when a person lifts both arms at once, one of them may drift downward).</li>\n \t<li><strong>S</strong>peech difficulty or trouble repeating a sentence.</li>\n \t<li><strong>T</strong>ime to call 911. Call 911 immediately and make note of when the symptoms first appeared.</li>\n</ul>\nWith every minute being critical, do not drive to the hospital. Call 911 immediately and let the dispatcher know the person has stroke-like symptoms. Stay calm and give CPR if the person does not have a pulse or stops breathing. It is important to remember that you should not give someone with stroke symptoms any medication, food or beverages. Strokes can cause the loss of muscle control in the face and neck, which can increase the risk of choking.\n<h2>What increases your risk of having a stroke?</h2>\nStrokes can occur at any age. According to the CDC, in 2009, 34% of people hospitalized for stroke were less than 65 years old. The great news is that stroke can be preventable. Certain behaviors can help reduce one’s overall risk for stroke. Quitting smoking is one of the most important things someone can do to prevent a possible stroke. Smoking doubles the risk of having a stroke. Otherwise, maintaining an overall healthy lifestyle with normal weight, blood pressure and cholesterol levels can help immensely.\n\nSeconds matter when stroke-like symptoms are present. Remember to <em>BE FAST </em>and seek immediate medical attention.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/mouhammad-jumaa-md-neurology\">Mouhammad Jumaa, MD,</a> is a neurointerventionalist with ProMedica Stroke Network.

    "Title": "Tips for Coping with Hemodialysis Treatment",
    "Content": "Receiving hemodialysis care can be a lifelong journey or a temporary process. Either way, patients want treatment to be an easy and comfortable process with confidence that they are receiving quality care. If you or your loved one is receiving hemodialysis, learning more about the treatment and tips for coping can help make it a smoother experience.\n<h2>What is dialysis?</h2>\n“Hemodialysis, or dialysis, is a procedure that removes toxins and excess fluid from the body of patients whose kidneys do not work,” stated Caroline Mak, RN, BSN, operational manager, hemodialysis unit, at ProMedica Toledo Hospital.\n\nKidneys filter the blood to help the body maintain a healthy balance of water, salt, and various minerals. The kidneys normally do these functions for the body, but patients with certain conditions may have to take a different approach.\n\n“Hemodialysis is needed for patients with conditions of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or acute kidney injury (AKI),” explained Mak. “Hemodialysis treatment is vital for patients who have ESRD because patients will need dialysis for life unless they receive a kidney transplant. For patients with AKI, their kidneys may recover, and dialysis would be stopped.”\n<h2>Understanding Dialysis Treatment</h2>\nFor the most part, dialysis sessions are similar among patients. Mak explained, “The patient has dialysis access; either a central line or an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG). The patient is connected to a dialysis machine for a specific amount of time that the nephrologist orders; the blood is filtered through the machine to remove the toxins and excess fluid.”\n\nThe dialysis access may require pre-procedural treatment before patients begin their dialysis treatments. For example, when patients use a fistula or graft, they first need a procedure to have them inserted into either their arm or wrist. The fistula or graft will be connected between a vein and artery where the blood will flow directly during hemodialysis treatment. This procedure is usually done for patients who have to receive lifelong dialysis. Patients who receive temporary hemodialysis will receive dialysis access through a central line, which is like an IV that you would normally receive for quicker medical treatment.\n\nOnce patients begin hemodialysis, they usually receive treatment three times a week for 3.5 to 4 hours.\n<h2>Tips for Coping with Hemodialysis</h2>\nReceiving hemodialysis can be difficult, but there are things you can do to cope. Here are some tips for managing your treatment.\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Participate in your care.</strong> Caroline Mak said, “Discuss with your dialysis team why you need dialysis, learn/understand what foods to avoid; and what your medications are for. During your time of dialysis, you want to follow the plan of care that is developed with your dialysis team.” Creating a support system within your care team and family will help make the process of staying motivated during your treatment easier and more desirable to achieve your goals.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Find a friend.</strong> “Talk with others who are receiving dialysis; to learn how they cope/function,” recommended Mak. During your dialysis treatments, you will be on a schedule to receive treatment on the same days, so you will see the same people. Introducing yourself to others and making a friend will help you feel supported and create friendly accountability.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Bring something fun to do.</strong> Find a hobby that interests you and you can enjoy during treatment time. Reading a book, watching shows on streaming services, doing crossword puzzles, or listening to podcasts are all things that will help pass the time but do not conflict with treatment.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Consult with your doctor about medications. </strong>Dialysis treatment may affect your medications. Your doctor may recommend taking your medications after your dialysis treatment so that your medication will stay in your bloodstream.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Keep yourself comfortable. </strong>You as the patient can ensure you’re comfortable during your treatments by taking initiative yourself with these few tips such as: bringing a blanket so that you’re not cold during treatment, having something to eat before going to treatment and dressing comfortable with loose shirts/tops around your arm for easy access to the dialysis site are all ways</li>\n \t<li><strong>Get some rest after your treatment.</strong> Hemodialysis treatment can be draining for most patients so getting ample rest is best for your recovery on days you receive treatment.</li>\n</ul>",

    "Title": "Tips for Improving Your Digestive Health",
    "Content": "Is your digestion feeling slow and sluggish? Maybe stress is making your gut feel bloated. Many things in our life such as stress and what we eat can impact our gut health. There are several simple things you can do to take care of your gut health.\n<h2>Be mindful during meals.</h2>\nEating too much or too quickly can tax our digestive system. If our digestive system is overwhelmed, it may not work efficiently. This could lead to bloating and fatigue since we’re not properly breaking down our food. Try mindful eating where you take time to see, smell, taste and experience your food. Doing this with the first few bites of food could make your meal more satisfying meaning you could eat less.\n<h2>Try cooked foods.</h2>\nSalads and raw veggies are great but sometimes may make your belly unhappy. Cold and raw foods like a salad take more energy and effort for your stomach to break down. Foods that have been cooked for a long time like soups, stews, things cooked in a slow cooker can be easier to digest and are less effort for our digestive system to break down. Maybe switch out a couple of cold lunches per week and substitute a soup instead.\n<h2>Make mealtime all about the meal.</h2>\nWe all live busy lives and often find ourselves checking emails, reading a paper, etc., during a meal. You may not realize it but reading that email may be stressing you out while you are trying to eat. That stress could put strain on our gut leading to discomfort and other gut issues. Try to make mealtime only about the meal. Take a few minutes to unplug and try to focus on just eating. Your gut will be happier when it only has to digest a meal and not deal with stress, too!\n<h2>Consider natural products or therapies.</h2>\nSome natural products and therapies can be used to support your overall gut health.

    "Title": "Early Screening Can Help Prevent Colorectal Cancer",
    "Content": "In the United States, colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths for both men and women.\n\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, colorectal cancer is expected to cause around 52,580 deaths in 2022 alone. Despite that, colorectal cancer is very easily preventable and treatable if caught early with screening.\n\nA colonoscopy is a procedure that allows a surgical team to view inside the entire colon and rectum while the patient is sedated. The great news is that the screening procedure is painless, and the patient often does not remember the procedure after waking when the colonoscopy is completed.\n\nWhile the colonoscopy is being performed, the physician looks for signs of cancer or polyps. Polyps are best described as small lumps or moles that grow inside the large intestine or rectum. When a polyp is found during a colonoscopy, the physician can remove it and have it tested for cancer. Polyps are generally considered precancerous if found and removed early.\n<h2>Signs and Symptoms of Colorectal Cancer</h2>\nColorectal cancer usually does not show symptoms for many years. On average, it takes a polyp between five to 10 years to develop into cancer. Usually, when a patient develops symptoms, the cancer is already in a late stage.\n\nSome common symptoms of colorectal cancer include blood in the stool, changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain or cramps that don’t go away, anemia and weight loss.\n<h2>Risk Factors and When to Screen</h2>\nLike every form of cancer, colorectal cancer has specific risk factors that contribute to the likelihood of someone developing it.\n\nSome risk factors of colorectal cancer can be controlled, including being overweight, an inactive lifestyle, a diet high in red meats and processed foods, alcohol use and smoking.\n\nOther risk factors cannot be controlled, such as aging, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, an inherited syndrome or family history.\n\nSo when should someone get screened for colorectal cancer? The American Cancer Society recommends that people with an average risk begin regular screenings at age 45.\n\nHowever, if a family member has had colorectal cancer or precancerous polyps removed during a colonoscopy, the risk increases. Those with a family history of polyps or colorectal cancer should be screened 10 years prior to when the polyp or cancer was found in the family member if they are below the recommended age of 45.\n\nIt is important to note that African Americans have the highest colorectal cancer rate and associated mortality rate of all ethnic groups in the United States. Because of this, early screening is imperative to reduce the rate of colon cancer and related deaths in African Americans.\n<h2>Types of Tests</h2>\nColonoscopy is the only proven method to prevent colon cancer. There are stool-based tests that can help detect colorectal cancer, but they fail to detect precancerous lesion in many patients. If you think undergoing a stool test is best for you, keep in mind that an abnormal result will require you to undergo a colonoscopy to determine what the problem actually is. So, why not start with the screening that provides the most reliable results?\n\nPatients may get a false sense of security with a stool test, thinking they have undergone proper prevention, when in reality, they have not. Even newer stool-based tests failed to detect precancerous lesion up to 40-60% of the time. Therefore, even though they are approved tests, do not miss the opportunity to prevent colon cancer because of a lack of information.\n\nHaving yourself or a loved one undergo a major surgery or chemotherapy; and waking up every morning for years wondering if colorectal cancer will return, adds a significant amount of stress to your life and your family. Colonoscopies are the only tests that can detect and remove precancerous polyps before they turn into colorectal cancer. In most cases, lesions can even be removed during the colonoscopy, allowing you to avoid a major surgery.\n<h2>Prevention is Key</h2>\nBe your own health care advocate! If you are 45 or older, ask your doctor to help you book a colonoscopy. If you have a family history of colon cancer or colon polyps, ask your doctor to help you schedule a colonoscopy, starting 10 years before the age your family member was diagnosed with colon cancer or colon polyps. If you have symptoms of colorectal cancer, talk to your doctor about a colonoscopy right away. If you have a significant family history of colon cancer or colon polyps, a genetic evaluation may be best for you, and screening should be tailored to your own personal situation.\n\nUnderstanding that colon polyps and colon cancer run in families, please let your siblings, brothers or sisters and parents know if you have polyps or were diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Be the first to help to keep your loved ones safe, as they may need to undergo screening as well. Overall, the most important point is to get screened. No matter what test you choose. However, keep in mind that not all tests are the same when it comes to prevention.\n\n<em>Raul Bosio, MD, is a board-certified colon and rectal surgeon with ProMedica Physicians General Surgery. <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/raul-bosio-md-colorectal-surgery\">View his profile.</a></em>",

    "Content": "Riley Runnells knew something was wrong when her right arm was swollen to about two or three times its usual size. Although a blood clot is pretty rare for a young adult, that's exactly what she had. It was caused by a condition called thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).\n\nTOS occurs when the muscles and bone structure in your body doesn't leave enough room for the nerves and veins to function freely. Most people are born with the structure issues, but sometimes repetitive motion at work, exercise or trauma can contribute to the problem.\n\n\"These structures are compressing the vein, and with the vein being compressed in that area, it essentially causes poor flow from the arm to the heart and with the stagnation of the blood, you can end up with a clotting, or thrombosis of the vein,\" explained <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/jihad-abbas-md-facs-vascular-surgery\">Jihad Abbas, MD, FACS</a>, ProMedica Physicians Jobst Vascular.\n\nDr. Abbas and his team worked to first dissolve Riley's blood clot and later removed Riley's first rib to ensure that her vein would get proper blood flow.\n\nLearn more about Riley's story and the symptoms and treatments for those diagnosed with TOS in the video below.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5RMh2XnupY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<em>Learn more about vascular care services on <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/vascular-care/\">ProMedica's website.</a></em>",

    "Title": "Natural Ways to Support Heart Health",
    "Content": "Heart health is something that we should always be thinking about since our heart is what keeps us going. Here are some considerations to keep your heart in tip top shape.\n<h2>Relax and De-stress</h2>\nStress can affect our body in many ways including impacting our heart health. We can experience higher blood pressure when stressed. High blood pressure makes our heart work harder and over time this can be very taxing on our heart and could lead to a higher chance of heart attack or stroke. Take a minute to think about how you manage stress.\n\nHere are two questions to consider:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Do you have anything you enjoy that you can incorporate into your day to help your stress level?</li>\n \t<li>Do you have a hobby or interest that maybe you haven’t done in a while that you brings you joy and could help you de-stress?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Eat for Heart Health</h2>\nDiet is important for many aspects of our health, especially our heart. Low sodium diets such as the <a href=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/wellness/dash-your-way-to-a-healthier-heart/\">DASH diet</a> have long been suggested for those who need to keep their blood pressure low. Make sure to check labels on food for salt content and do your best to resist picking up that salt shaker! Fats and types of fats can also be important when eating for heart health. Fried, greasy foods could increase our cholesterol levels which can lead to dangerous clogging of the arteries of the heart. French fries might be tasty but eat these in moderation to keep your heart and blood vessels happy. And try not to avoid fats altogether, good fats such as healthy oils (in moderation) can support overall health. Before you decide to make any major dietary changes, talk to your healthcare provider to make sure it’s right for you and your specific health needs.\n<h2>Just Add Spice</h2>\nIf eating a healthier heart diet seems boring or bland, add some spice! Spices can add more flavor to food and often have health benefits of their own. Cinnamon has blood pressure and blood sugar lowering effects. Try adding some to your morning oatmeal or yogurt. The bright yellow spice turmeric will make your food more appealing to look at and taste. Turmeric can act as a natural anti-inflammatory, which could help support the lining of the blood vessels that bring blood flow to the heart. Turmeric and cinnamon together can make a delicious tea to help you get a heart healthy start to your day.\n<h2>Get Sweating</h2>\nWhen done safely, exercise that raises our heart rate, also known as cardiovascular exercise or cardio, can support heart health. This type of exercise makes the heart muscle work harder and can help to <a href=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/wellness/why-is-exercise-so-good-for-your-heart-2/\">strengthen the muscle</a>. The heart is a large muscle and could use strengthening just like the other muscles in our body. How else can you work up a sweat? Use a sauna. Research suggests that time spent in a sauna, steam or infrared sauna, can raise our heart rate and mimic the benefits of cardiovascular exercise. Always remember to start slow when starting a new exercise program and of course check with your healthcare provider.\n<h2>Consider Some Supplements</h2>\nIf you’re doing all of these things for your heart health and keeping up with seeing your healthcare provider, what else can you do for your heart? Consider adding supplements for additional heart and health support.\n\nOmega fatty acids, such as those found in fish oil, are a good type of fat that could support the heart by decreasing inflammation in the blood vessels of the heart. Fish oil can be found in a capsule or liquid form. Coenzyme Q10, or CoQ10, has been suggested through several research studies to support heart and cardiovascular health in many ways. CoQ10 may lower blood pressure, help symptoms of heart failure, and could decrease the chance of another heart attack in those who have had a heart attack. Also, certain medications may lower the levels of CoQ10 your body makes naturally.\n\nIf high blood pressure is a concern, consider fermented garlic. Garlic capsules could help lower blood pressure in conjunction with other measures such as blood pressure medication. Worried you’ll smell like garlic? Most garlic capsules have been processed so that there is little to no garlic odor. Not all supplements are right for everyone and some may even interact with certain medications, so check with your healthcare provider and/or pharmacist before starting a new supplement.\n\nYour heart works hard every day. Show it some love by taking some heart healthy steps!\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "Year-Round Heart Health Could Save Your Life",
    "Content": "Have you considered your heart health recently?\n\nFebruary is American Heart Month which reminds us to focus on our cardiovascular health. Taking routine steps to care for your heart and knowing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack could save your life.\n\nEach year, American Heart Month is celebrated to motivate Americans to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle to prevent heart disease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), each year, about 805,000 people in the United States have a heart attack. A heart attack, or myocardial infarction, occurs when there is a prolonged decrease of blood or oxygen to the heart. This results in the death of heart muscle. There are several ways this can occur, the most common instances being blockage of a coronary artery and plaque rupture.\n<h2>Heart Attack Symptoms</h2>\nEvery 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack. Understanding common and atypical symptoms can help get you or a loved one life-saving care quickly.\n\nThe most common symptom of a heart attack is chest pain. Atypical symptoms of a heart attack include nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, pain in the arm, jaw, back or neck. Heart attack symptoms can vary between men and women. Men typically have more classic chest pain, whereas women tend to have more atypical symptoms. It is also possible to have a silent heart attack. A silent heart attack occurs when either minimal or no symptoms are present.\n<h2>Know Where to Go</h2>\nSeeking medical attention is imperative if heart attack symptoms are present. If proper medical attention is not obtained in those critical first moments of a heart attack, heart damage can become permanent, and a person could suffer fatal effects.\n\nThe emergency room is the best course of action for heart attack symptoms. All patients with suspected heart attack symptoms will be triaged and seen by a qualified physician. Never drive yourself or a loved one to the emergency room; calling 911 will help ensure that care is received as quickly as possible.\n<h2>Heart Health Begins at Home</h2>\nHeart disease is and continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have found ourselves spending more time at home. Unfortunately, this has not decreased the risk of heart disease. For some, the risk has increased.\n\nEven if a person has not been diagnosed with heart disease, they may still be at risk for a heart attack. Several factors may put a person at risk. Some of these risk factors include obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes, family history, age, sex and a sedentary lifestyle.\n\nThe good news is there are several small changes you can begin doing today to help keep your heart healthy. Eating heart-healthy foods, staying active and limiting alcohol are great options to begin taking care of your heart at home.\n<h2>Heart-Healthy Diet and Lifestyle</h2>\nA healthy diet and lifestyle are the keys to preventing heart disease. Maintaining a diet of fruit, leafy green vegetables, nuts, whole grains, fish, lean meats, and healthy oils helps support overall heart health. Limiting red meat, foods with lots of sodium and processed foods can also lower risk.\n\nExercise goes hand-in-hand with a heart-healthy diet. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity weekly, preferably spread throughout the week.\n<h2>Limiting Alcohol Intake</h2>\nIncreased alcohol consumption contributes to a higher risk for raised blood pressure. It can also contribute to other heart issues such as an irregular heartbeat and stroke. It’s recommended that men have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women have no more than one.\n\nTaking steps to be conscious of your heart health can help keep your risk for heart disease low throughout the year. Reflecting on heart health in February is a good reminder for us all but remember that taking care of your heart health year-round and knowing the signs and symptoms of a heart attack could save your life.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/brian-dolsey-md-facc-fscai-interventional-cardiology\">Brian Dolsey, MD, FACC, FSCAI</a>, is a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians. </em>",

    "Title": "5 Things To Know About Pelvic Pain",
    "Content": "If you’ve experienced pelvic pain, you know that it can affect every part of your life and make it difficult to function. It may also seem hard to tell if the pain or discomfort you’re experiencing is normal. While some describe pelvic pain as a dull ache or heaviness in the pelvis, others have cramping and sharper bouts of pain. However you experience it, it’s important to know that chronic pelvic pain – which lasts for at least six months – isn’t normal and can be treated.\n\nIf you have regular pain or discomfort in the pelvis, read on to learn more about the condition.\n<h2>1. Pelvic pain isn’t always in the pelvis.</h2>\nIt makes sense that we would think that the pain is coming from where we feel it, but referred pain is common when it comes to pelvic pain. That’s because our abdomens do a poor job of localizing pain. Women may describe the pain as being in the abdominal wall, lower back and/or buttocks. However, a gynecological exam can reveal the pain is actually coming from the vagina. It’s not like having a paper cut on your finger, when you can tell the exact location with your eyes closed. That’s because the abdomen doesn’t have extraordinarily sensitive nerve endings like other parts of the body.\n<h2>2. It may be a treatable condition called chronic pelvic pain syndrome.</h2>\nThe pain is present for six or more months and is non-cyclic, meaning while it may get worse during your period, it never entirely goes away. Conventional treatments like ibuprofen or acetaminophen just aren’t doing the trick. The pain is stronger than what you’d expect from the injury, surgery or condition that may have initially caused the pain. You’re having difficulty sleeping. You’re constipated. You’ve lost your appetite. You feel like you’re moving in slow motion. You’re depressed. You’re getting less physical activity and may be missing work due to the pain.\n<h2>3. Sex should never be painful.</h2>\nIt’s common for some women to experience pain when they first become sexually active, but this usually resolves with continued intercourse over a few months. After that, sex should not be painful.\n\nYet, <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16422861/\">at least one in 10 women</a> has pain during sex. And <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1751721417302075\">90% of women</a> with a history of chronic pelvic pain report pain during intercourse.<sup>3</sup> Younger women may feel pain upon initial insertion, which can be related to the nerve fibers at the opening of the vagina. Menopausal or postmenopausal women may feel dry due to the lack of estrogen, when lubrication is lessened and the tissues of the vagina tend to thin.\n\nWomen of any age may feel deep pain with intercourse related to the pelvic floor muscles, which may be caused by pelvic floor myofascial pain. Myofascial pain – a common type of pain that’s often under-recognized and misdiagnosed – comes from the dysfunction, hypersensitivity or hypercontractivity of the muscles in the abdominal wall, pelvic floor and lower back. So painful sex may be common, but that doesn’t make it normal.\n<h2>4. Kegels are not for everyone.</h2>\nKegels can help strengthen pelvic floor muscles, but they aren’t recommended for everyone, especially those with chronic pelvic pain.\n\n<a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/ct/35511/p-0049/Bct/l-0188/l-0188:1/ct13_0/1/l?sid=TV2%3A1pw982Nhz\">Heather Wahl, MD</a>, an OB/Gyn specializing in chronic pelvic pain with ProMedica Pelvic Health says, “Kegels are one of the worst exercises some women with chronic pelvic pain can do. That’s because if your muscles are already hypercontracted, doing a Kegel will only increase muscle contraction in muscles that actually need to be relaxed.”\n\nGetting those muscles to relax and be better coordinated is key. Pelvic floor physical therapy can help those with hypercontractivity by relaxing the muscles that are causing pain. In short, don’t self-diagnose and self-treat with Kegels. It’s important to talk to a gynecologist who will listen and create a treatment plan.\n<h2>5. Don’t stop exercising.</h2>\nOften, when people feel chronic pain, they become less active. After all, who wants to go to the gym when you’re not feeling like yourself? But decreased activity can actually worsen chronic pelvic pain, because when you stop or decrease your activity, your muscles become deconditioned.\n\nStrength training, cardio, stretching, yoga and walking are great activities to continue to enjoy if you can. Multiple studies have shown the benefits of exercise for improving chronic pelvic pain and pain with periods. This activity, along with pelvic floor physical therapy (done under the supervision of a professional), meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy and sleep, are common non-medical treatments for pelvic pain.",

    "Title": "Diabetes: What is it and how does it affect the body?",
    "Content": "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), just over 1 in 10 Americans have diabetes. Understanding diabetes and how it affects your body is important for recognizing the symptoms and knowing how to manage the condition.\n\nRachel Rocha, PharmD, CDE, and Chuck Riepenhoff, RPh, CDE, ProMedica Diabetes and Nutrition Education Services, explain that diabetes causes a breakdown in the way our body distributes sugar, which is needed for energy.\n\n“Our pancreas makes insulin. Insulin is responsible for helping our body get sugar out of the blood and get to where it needs to go in the body so it can turn into energy for us,” says Riepenhoff.\n\n“However, with diabetes, there’s a breakdown in that process,” explains Rocha. “So the sugar does not go from the blood to the muscles, tissues and cells. Instead, it builds up in the blood. And over time, it can create some issues for your body.”\n\nUncontrolled diabetes can lead to complications such as kidney disease, an increased risk of heart events such as stroke or heart attack, and can even cause permanent damage to the eyes.\n\nLearn more about the basics of diabetes from Rocha and Riepenhoff in the video below.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wrYrPz_rxQk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n<em>For more information about diabetes care, visit <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/diabetes\">ProMedica’s website</a>.</em>",

    "Title": "Care Options for Sickle Cell Patients",
    "Content": "Sickle cell disease is the most common blood disorder in the world. It changes red blood cells in the body from round and flexible to stiff, sticky and sickle-shaped. This can cause the cells to get stuck and jam up, causing swelling, pain and other complications.\n\nEight-year-old Zyann was diagnosed with sickle cell disease as a baby. Her symptoms began when she was just two months old. Her mother, Jerri Hooks, noticed that she was cranky, wasn't eating normally and had swelling in her hands. Zyann was hospitalized numerous times and began using a medication to help with symptoms.\n\nNow, her symptoms have improved but her mother still has to monitor her symptoms closely. \"I check her temperature, see how she's eating, taking her water -- just watching her daily activities. If she doesn't do anything that she normally does or if she's sluggish with it,\" said Ms. Hooks.\n\nZyann receives care at the <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-comprehensive-pediatric-sickle-cell-clinic\">pediatric sickle cell clinic</a> at ProMedica Ebeid Children's Hospital. In 2019, an <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/location/promedica-comprehensive-adult-sickle-cell-clinic\">adult sickle cell clinic</a> was introduced at the hospital to advance care for patients, especially as they transition into adulthood.\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/crawford-j-strunk-md-pediatric-hematologyoncology\">Crawford Strunk, MD,</a> pediatric hematologist/oncologist, explains, \"There's a period from the ages of about 16-25 as patients are transitioning from pediatric care to adult care, that leaves them at a much higher risk for morbidity and mortality related disease. There's a much higher incidence of death in that age group than there is at either side of that age group.\"\n\nOne reason is because there are so few doctors who specialize in sickle cell disease, and many are focused on pediatric patients. The new clinic will help Zyann and other patients get the care they need during these critical ages.\n\nLearn more about Zyann's story and sickle cell disease care at ProMedica in the video below.\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUxWZLjAOEU\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>",

    "Title": "Find the Right Exercises for Your Aching Joints",
    "Content": "Exercising when your joints hurt can be a challenge. But to keep them in good working order, it’s essential to keep moving. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Determining which exercise is best takes a little know-how, and an understanding of your specific condition, current health, needs and goals.\n\nCreating the right exercise plan for you takes patience, and sometimes, a little trial and error. Working with your doctor for exercise recommendations and guidance is always a good place to start. For example, if your current exercise routine is causing pain or you’re not sure which type of exercise to start with, physical therapists are uniquely positioned to address these concerns.\n\nDr. Michael Studnicka, DPT, OMPT, physical therapist at ProMedica, explains, “We start with history and a physical examination to determine the cause of symptoms and the tissues that are painful. With this knowledge and utilizing evidence-based practice, we initiate a treatment plan to address these impairments.”\n\n“Particular to therapeutic exercise, we can use gravity with or without resistance starting with simple motions and if tolerated expanding to more functional movements,” he adds. “If this causes pain, we can perform gravity eliminated exercises while the condition continues to heal and return back to gravity when appropriate. We just have to work together until we find the right mix of physical activity for you.”\n<h2>Discover Different Types of Exercise</h2>\nWhen mapping a course for feeling better, it helps to know your options. Dr. Studnicka suggests learning about a few different types of exercise, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Low-impact aerobic exercise. </strong>Sometimes called “joint-friendly” exercise by doctors, low-impact exercise minimizes the effects on weight-bearing joints, especially your knees, hips, and spine. Aquatic exercise is one example of a low-impact activity that can help you improve muscle strength while minimizing joint stress.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Flexibility and range of motion exercises. </strong>Slow, controlled flexibility and range of motion exercises that don’t increase pain can help you protect your joints, improve your cartilage health and stay comfortable during routine daily activities.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Strength training exercises. </strong>Strengthening or resistance exercises use weights or bands to help you increase function and reduce pain.</li>\n</ul>\nIt’s not just about the type of exercise you do, but <em>how</em> you exercise that counts. A trained professional can help ensure that your movements are safe and effective.\n<h2>Use the SMART Method</h2>\nIgnore the old adage, “No pain, no gain.” If exercises are causing symptoms to worsen, they may be contributing to inflammation and tissue damage. It’s essential to learn how to exercise safely and to modify your activity when arthritic symptoms increase. Don’t push through the pain. If it hurts, you should stop.\n\n“Generally, you want to remain as active as you can, but you need to stop when your joints begin to hurt,” says Dr. Studnicka. “If this warning sign is ignored, the inflammatory process will start. Depending on the severity of pain that results, it could stop you from exercising for a couple days or halt work on a project.”\n\nPhysical therapists can teach pain management strategies so when a joint begins to hurt, a few simple movements combined with a short rest break can make it easier to resume the exercise or project.\n\nTo enjoy the benefits of increased activity, use the SMART method:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>S</strong>tart low, go slow.</li>\n \t<li><strong>M</strong>odify activity when arthritis symptoms increase. Try to stay active.</li>\n \t<li><strong>A</strong>ctivities should be joint friendly.</li>\n \t<li><strong>R</strong>ecognize safe places and ways to be active.</li>\n \t<li><strong>T</strong>alk to a health professional or certified exercise specialist.</li>\n</ul>\nExercise should help you improve, and not be an arduous, painful task. If you’re exercising more and enjoying it less — and aren’t seeing improvement — modify your routine.\n\nTo get the most out of your workout, you can modify any or all of the five variables of physical exercise:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Arc of movement:</strong> If a movement is painful, change the range and/or angle.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Duration:</strong> Change how long you do an exercise.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Change how often you exercise.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Intensity:</strong> Change how hard you exercise.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Change how fast you exercise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Get Started With a Plan</h2>\nA medical professional, such as your family doctor, specialist or physical therapist, can help you create an effective exercise plan that supports your joints and overall health. They may also be able to help you address other areas that support joint health.\n\nFor instance, if you're overweight, losing even a little bit of weight may help your joints feel better. “Losing one pound of weight results in four pounds of pressure being removed from the knees. In other words, losing just 10 pounds would relieve 40 pounds of pressure from your knees”, says Dr. Studnicka. “And this translates to less pain and more exercise.” Once you feel that difference, it can motivate you to keep going.\n\n<em>Michael Studnicka, DPT, OMPT, is a <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/physical-therapy\">physical therapist at ProMedica</a>.</em>",

    "Title": "Supporting Heart Health During the Holiday Season",
    "Content": "During the holidays, we often see a rise in heart-related issues, including heart attacks. One reason is that our dedication to our health typically falls to the wayside during the busy holidays. We neglect our regular exercise routine; we overindulge in processed or fatty foods, and we drink more alcohol. Additionally, increased levels of stress, feelings of depression and lack of sleep can take its toll on the body.\n\nBy supporting your heart health, you can lower your risk of heart issues during the holidays and set yourself up for the start of a healthy new year.\n<h2>Lower Your Risk for a Heart Issue</h2>\nHere are some ways to support your heart health during the holidays:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Stay active during the season.</strong> The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic activity, preferably spread throughout the week. Moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity is recommended at least twice a week.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Eat heart healthy foods.</strong> Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, lean meats, fish and healthy oils are foods that help support your heart health. Limit red meat, packaged foods, and foods with lots of salt or sodium.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Limit your alcohol intake.</strong> Increased alcohol consumption contributes to a higher risk for raised blood pressure and can contribute to other heart issues such as an irregular heartbeat and stroke. It’s recommended that men have no more than two alcoholic drinks per day and women have no more than one.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Reduce your holiday stress.</strong> Ongoing stress can increase your heart rate, blood pressure and your body’s demand for oxygen – all which can affect your heart. The holiday season can be busy, stressful and emotionally challenging. Find ways to cope and work with a mental health professional if needed.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Stay on top of your heart medications.</strong> The holiday season can disrupt our daily schedules. If you’re on a schedule with prescribed medications, make sure you continue to take the right dose at the right times. Set a phone reminder or use a pill pack to help remember.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Schedule your routine check-up.</strong> The end of the year is almost here. Have you had your 2020 annual check-up? If not, schedule an appointment with your primary care provider to help identify any potential heart issues and support your overall health.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Be careful in the cold. </strong>Being in the cold weather can cause our blood vessels to constrict, making it harder for your blood to pump through the body. Strenuous outdoor activity, such as shoveling snow, can increase the workload on the heart, especially among those who smoke, have diabetes or have an existing heart condition.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recognize a Heart Attack Quickly</h2>\nKnowing the signs of a heart attack can help you get life-saving care quickly, which is important for minimizing the damage to your heart. Unfortunately, many people are not aware of the major signs of a heart attack. Especially during the holiday season, symptoms may be ignored when people don’t want to worry friends and family or think they are just experiencing some indigestion. Not everyone with a heart attack has the type of chest-clutching heart attack you see on television. Signs of a heart attack may include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Chest discomfort that can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain.</li>\n \t<li>Cold sweat, nausea or vomiting.</li>\n \t<li>Shortness of breath.</li>\n \t<li>Upper body discomfort in one or both arms, your back, neck, jaw or stomach.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you think you or a loved one may be having a heart attack, act fast. Call 911 and then slowly chew and swallow one full-strength, 325mg aspirin tablet. Chewing it will help your body absorb it more quickly to “thin” the blood and make it more difficult for a potential blood clot to grow. Never drive yourself or a loved one to the emergency room; an ambulance will keep you safe and get you help faster.\n\nThis holiday season, protect your health by recognizing the signs of a life-threatening emergency and taking steps to reduce your risk for heart issues.",

Menses can be a trigger in some women,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/selena-nicholas-bublick-md-mhs-neurology\">Selena Nicholas-Bublick, MD, MHS,</a> a neurologist with ProMedica Physicians. “Women are 3 times more likely to be affected with migraine compared to men and 85% of patients with chronic migraine are women.”\n<h2>The Five Phases of a Migraine</h2>\nWhen people think about migraines, they tend to focus on pain. However, Dr. Nicholas-Bublick outlines that a single migraine can actually be thought of as having five different phases:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Prodromal/Premonitory phase:</strong> Hours to days before the headache pain begins, patients may experience food cravings, neck discomfort, yawning, gastrointestinal issues, mood changes and irritability. About 80% of migraine sufferers have a prodromal migraine phase.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Aura:</strong> About one-third of people with migraines experience an “aura” five to 60 minutes before other symptoms begin. Auras often disappear when migraine pain starts (but not always) and can include visual disturbances such as flashes of light, blind spots, tunnel vision and tingling in the hands or face.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Headache: </strong>Sometimes called the pain phase, this can last 4 to 72 hours. Pain is on only one side of the head, pulsating with moderate to severe intensity that worsens with routine physical activity. There can be nausea, vomiting, light and sound sensitivity.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Postdrome:</strong> After the headache pain goes away, patients can still experience symptoms that can last anywhere from 24-48 hours. Symptoms can include poor concentration, sensitivity to touch (especially on the head), depressed mood and fatigue.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Interictal: </strong>During this phase a person may be relatively symptom-free. Some individuals are sensitive to light, sound and certain odors, such as cigarette smoke.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Tracking Your Migraines</h2>\nDr. Nicholas-Bublick recommends talking to your primary care provider about your headaches if you find that they are beginning to interfere with daily life or are requiring more and more over-the-counter medications to be controlled. “Your primary care provider knows your health and can begin investigations into possible underlying causes. They can also assist with referrals to headache specialists if needed,” she says.\n\nIt’s a good idea to keep a headache journal for a month or two before seeing a provider and many apps available on Android and iOS phones can help you track this information. When you get a headache, record the following information:\n<ul>\n \t<li>How long it lasts.</li>\n \t<li>Over-the-counter medications you take and how effective they are.</li>\n \t<li>Symptoms you experience.</li>\n \t<li>What may have triggered the headache.</li>\n</ul>\nThis will help your provider determine whether your headaches are migraines and if they are “episodic” or chronic; information that’s critical to treatment planning. Episodic migraines occur 14 days or fewer a month, and chronic migraines occur 15 or more days a month with headaches lasting 4 hours or longer (for over three months).\n<h2>Finding a Treatment Strategy</h2>\nTreatment strategies for migraines are quite varied and depend on the individual. It is thus important to have a conversation with your provider about which medications or therapy may be best suited to your needs.\n\nSuccessful preventive treatment of migraines reduces the burden of headaches and improves overall quality of life.  “Everyone is different, and it may take time to find the right combination of medication and lifestyle changes you need to experience relief,” notes Dr. Nicholas-Bublick.\n\nPreventive therapies include oral and injectable medications, including botulinum toxin injections or BOTOX®.\n\nOther considerations when discussing migraines are potential comorbidities such as insomnia, sleep apnea, depression, anxiety and lack of physical activity. It is a good idea to have a full clinical evaluation if migraines are suspected.\n\n<em>Learn more about the diagnosis and treatment of migraine headaches on <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/migraine-headaches\">ProMedica's website</a>.</em>",

    "Title": "What to Know About the COVID-19 Vaccine Booster",
    "Content": "With transmission rates for COVID-19 still high in most of the country, the vaccine booster is an important way to keep people safe and prevent the risk of spreading infection. Brian Kaminski, DO, CPPS, a board-certified emergency medicine physician and vice president of quality and patient safety at ProMedica, shares details about the vaccine booster shot and what to expect.\n<h2>How does the COVID-19 booster shot work?</h2>\nThe COVID-19 booster is an additional dose of the same COVID-19 vaccine,” explained Dr. Kaminski. “After vaccination, the immune response in most people fades over time. The additional dose helps induce an immune response that’s greater than the initial dose or two doses.”\n\nStrengthening our body’s immune response with a booster helps us be more proactive with our health, especially as we head into the winter and flu seasons.\n<h2>What types of booster shots are offered?</h2>\nCurrently, vaccines from three manufacturers are being offered to the American public: Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen.\n\nIf you initially received a Pfizer or Moderna (mRNA) vaccine, you should wait at least six months after completing your primary COVID-19 vaccination series before receiving a booster. The <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a> currently says those ages 18+ <em>may</em> get a booster, and that all people ages 50+ and those 18+ living in a long-term care setting <em>should </em>get a booster.\n\nIf you initially received the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen (viral vector) vaccine, you should wait at least two months after receiving the initial dose before getting your booster. You are eligible if you are 18+ years old.\n\nOne benefit of the vaccination booster is being able to switch the type of vaccination you receive after your primary vaccination series. You can receive Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson &amp; Johnson’s/Janssen no matter which vaccine series you initially received.\n<h2>What should you expect after your booster shot?</h2>\nThe booster may cause common side effects similar to or milder than what you experienced shortly after your initial vaccination.and they usually only last 24 to 48 hours. Dr. Kaminski stated, “It isn’t uncommon for people to have short-term side effects from any dose of the vaccine. We do see people have ordinary side effects such as low duration fever, muscle aches, body aches, and fatigue, all of which tend to go away in a day or two.”\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, and vaccination is one of the best ways to keep you and others from contracting the virus and experiencing severe illness. The booster helps to provide an extra level of protection that enables us to more safely return to the activities we have missed during the pandemic.\n\nIf you have questions about the vaccine or booster, talk with your primary care provider. You can learn more about vaccinations on <a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/covid\">ProMedica’s website</a>.",

    "Title": "What is a STEMI heart attack?",
    "Content": "Knowing how to take action quickly during a heart attack could save a life or help you or a family member avoid permanent disability. That’s especially true in the case of a serious kind of heart attack known as a “STEMI.”\n<h2>Diagnosing<strong> a STEMI </strong></h2>\nIn a STEMI heart attack (ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction), a coronary artery in the heart is completely (not partially) blocked. The damage is so severe it causes electrical changes on an EKG, which alerts medical teams they must act quickly to restore blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\n“On the heart attack spectrum, a STEMI is the one that’s the most concerning and time-sensitive,” explains <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/hazem-malas-do-facc-cardiology\">Hazem Malas, DO, FACC,</a> a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians. “Since causing an electrical change implies it’s causing significant muscle damage, it’s crucial we start life-saving procedures right away.”\n\nThe national benchmark “door-to-balloon time” is used to measure the length of time between when a STEMI heart attack patient arrives at a hospital to when a cardiologist is able to perform a balloon angioplasty to get blood flowing again. Guidelines recommend less than 90 minutes.\n\n“We often use the description ‘time is muscle.’ The quicker we act, the more improved our patient’s long-term survival will be — so the quicker, the better,” Dr. Malas says.\n<h2>Leading Local Heart Attack Care</h2>\nNot all hospitals have the equipment or expertise needed to treat STEMI heart attacks. ProMedica Toledo Hospital, ProMedica Flower Hospital and ProMedica Monroe Regional Hospital are all STEMI-certified Chest Pain Centers, which means they have a track record of success in terms of outcomes and survival rates. It’s a wide-spread effort that includes:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Local 911 dispatch and EMS personnel who are trained to recognize STEMI symptoms, alert the right hospital, start therapies and move quickly.</li>\n \t<li>Emergency room and heart care teams, including physicians, nurses, technicians and support staff, who get ready for the patient and the procedures they will need.</li>\n \t<li>The cardiac critical care unit team who prepares to help the patient after the procedure to ensure long-term health.</li>\n \t<li>Advanced teams who stand ready to help with any complications, 365 days a year.</li>\n</ul>\nProviding this kind of coordinated, live-saving care is no small feat.\n\n“It’s a huge undertaking from a community and a hospital perspective. It’s a privilege to be in this position where we can do these procedures, save lives and do so in such a safe and efficient manner,” Dr. Malas shares.\n<h2>Taking Action for Your Heart</h2>\nIf you’re worried about heart symptoms, the sooner you get care, the better — even before a heart attack occurs. Seeing a doctor regularly also helps make sure your blood pressure, cholesterol and other health measures stay in check.\n\nAnd don’t think heart problems only happen to other people. Too often, patients ignore or downplay heart symptoms because they’re otherwise healthy or because they don’t have a classic symptom like chest pain.\n\nDr. Malas urges you not to think you can shake or sleep it off. “The earlier you recognize you need help, and see your doctor or call 911, the earlier your symptoms can be understood, a diagnosis can be made, and your treatment can be started — and the more likely that whatever happened isn’t going to cause permanent damage to your heart.”\n\n<em>To learn more about heart attack symptoms and care, visit </em><a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/247heart\"><em>ProMedica’s website.</em></a>",

    "Title": "When to Talk to Your Doctor About Pain",
    "Content": "<span data-contrast=\"none\">If you've experienced pain from an injury, surgery or other health condition, you know the debilitating effect it can have on your physical and mental health. Pain can be disruptive to your day-to-day activities, social life and even your sleep.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">But how long should you wait for pain to go away on its own before getting help? If your pain is interfering with your quality of life, it may be time to talk with your healthcare provider, says </span><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/ryan-m-szepiela-md-physical-medicine-and-rehabilitation\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ryan Szepiela, MD,</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> a board-certified physical medicine, rehabilitation and sports medicine physician at ProMedica.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Szepiela sees patients with pain in the muscles, joints, back, spine and nerves. No matter what type of pain you may be experiencing, he says it's never too soon to speak up about being sore.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">\"Pain is a natural response to the body telling you something is wrong,” he says. If you’re experiencing pain, don't hesitate to reach out and get an opinion.\" </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h2>Identifying the Source of Pain</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">\"The body is very complex. Sometimes pain overlaps and it's not apparent what's causing it,\" says Dr. Szepiela. \"Trying to find the pain generator is often the biggest battle.\"</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">There are two primary types of pain: acute pain and chronic pain. Identifying which type of pain you're in can help you get on a faster path to relief.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"43\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Acute pain</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> is pain or injury that lasts less than six months. A doctor can typically identify the cause of acute pain, such as recent surgery, a pulled muscle, a cut or burn or a broken bone. You can treat acute pain with a combination of home remedies, medications, injections or physical therapy. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"43\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Chronic pain</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\"> is pain that lasts longer than six months. The cause of this type of ongoing pain can be more challenging to identify and treat since it isn't always related to an injury. Chronic pain includes conditions like headaches, back pain, arthritis pain or nerve pain.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Knowing When to Seek Care</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">If your pain is overwhelming, reach out to your doctor or seek care right away. And watch for red flags that could be a sign of a more serious injury, says Dr. Szepiela. \"If you have significant weakness, shooting pains, nerve pain or pain radiating to other areas, you should talk to your provider. These types of symptoms could indicate other complications or potential injuries and are important to diagnose and treat immediately so the pain doesn't turn from acute to chronic.\"</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Rate your pain on a 10-point scale, with zero indicating no pain and 10 indicating the worst possible pain. Small, minor injuries that fall within a three or four on the scale will usually get better within two weeks with the help of over-the-counter medications, ice and rest.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">If pain persists or feels like a five or above, Dr. Szepiela recommends checking in with your doctor. It's better to identify and treat pain early to avoid other complications or long-term injuries and get you back to your regular activity. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h2>Talking to Your Doctor About Pain</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Everyone experiences pain differently. To help your doctor pinpoint your pain, prepare in advance by:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"44\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Accurately describing your pain</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Pain can be difficult to express, but using descriptive words — like constant ache, radiating pain, shooting pain, burning or stabbing pain — can help your doctor better understand. Describe any swelling or impact to movement to your doctor as well.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"44\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><b><span data-contrast=\"none\">Keeping a record of your pain</span></b><span data-contrast=\"none\">. Keeping a log or a journal of your pain and the intensity can also help you explain your pain. Do certain activities make it worse? Is it affecting your sleep? Has anything helped make it feel better? Helping your doctor understand what intensifies your pain can help them target the pain and its source.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Your doctor will listen and ask questions about any potential injuries to learn more about the source of the pain, ask about your medical history, give you a physical exam and possibly request tests or scans, like an X-ray, to assess any suspected injuries or conditions.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">You may also be referred to a doctor specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation, pain management, orthopaedics or sports medicine for further evaluation.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h2>Finding Effective Treatment</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Because pain comes in many different forms and from many causes, there’s no one-size-fits-all approach for treatment. Treating and managing pain or injury often requires a combination of methods and specialists tailored to your specific needs. Some common treatments include:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h3>Complementary Medicine</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">A pain management specialist may also recommend treatment options like acupuncture, chiropractic or massage to alleviate pain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h3>Medication</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Szepiela recommends starting with light medications like acetaminophen and ibuprofen, along with ice and rest. Your doctor can also prescribe muscle relaxants or nerve medications to relieve pain. It’s recommended to try these methods first before a prescription narcotic like oxycodone or hydrocodone. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“Narcotic medications ideally are used on a short-term basis,” says Dr. Szepiela. “We still use these medications when needed, but we want to use them in a controlled environment, appropriately and safely.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Supplements and natural medicines can also manage pain, but Dr. Szepiela advises reading warning labels first. “Just because something is natural or over-the-counter doesn’t mean it comes without complications. Check with your doctor before starting to use supplements or natural medicine to make sure there are no interactions with your current medications.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h3>Physical Therapy</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Physical therapy can help reduce pain by teaching you how to perform a movement correctly or restore movement to an area in pain. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h3>Psychological Support</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“There are a lot of emotions associated with being in pain,” says Dr. Szepiela. “And there is a direct correlation between chronic pain and depression and anxiety. If we don’t address the emotional aspect, we’re missing a significant portion of pain management.”  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h3>Surgery</h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Surgery is an option for some types of intractable pain or pain affecting the body’s functions. If you’ve gone through a wide range of treatments with no improvement and your pain affects your everyday activities, your doctor may refer you to an orthopaedic surgeon. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/ryan-m-szepiela-md-physical-medicine-and-rehabilitation\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Ryan Szepiela, MD</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\"> is a board-certified physical medicine, rehabilitation and sports medicine physician at ProMedica.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span><em>If you’re experiencing pain that is affecting your daily life, talk to your primary care provider or an <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/yourhealth/orthopaedics/\">orthopaedic</a> specialist. </em>",

    "Title": "What Everyone Should Know About Chest Pain",
    "Content": "<span data-contrast=\"none\">You’re going about your day, but don’t feel quite right. You have chest discomfort unlike anything you’ve experienced. You wonder if it’s a pulled muscle or perhaps a bad case of heartburn. After all, it’s not the crushing pain you’ve seen signal a heart problem on TV, so it couldn’t possibly be a heart attack. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Or could it? </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">The answer to that question is yes, it could be. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">More than 800,000 Americans have heart attacks each year. For many, chest discomfort — the kind that can be easily dismissed or mistaken for something else — is a key symptom. That makes knowing how to recognize heart-related chest discomfort especially important. If a heart attack is to blame for your symptoms, acting fast could save your life. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h2>Recognizing Heart Attack Symptoms<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559745&quot;:1,&quot;335559746&quot;:1}\"> </span></h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“When you’re having a heart attack, an artery supplying blood to your heart is blocked,” said </span><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/william-colyer-jr-md-facc-cardiology\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">William Colyer, Jr., MD, FACC</span></a><span data-contrast=\"none\">, a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians Cardiology. “That prevents oxygen and nutrients from reaching the heart muscle, and that can generally be felt.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">The problem is that while chest discomfort is a textbook symptom of a blocked heart artery, people tend to describe their discomfort differently. Some refer to it as pain or pressure. Others say it’s a feeling of tightness or squeezing in their chest. Of course, there are many other heart attack symptoms, including:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"40\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"1\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Pain in the neck, back or shoulders that can sometimes extend to the left jaw and down the left arm.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"40\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"2\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Shortness of breath.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n \t<li data-leveltext=\"\" data-font=\"Symbol\" data-listid=\"40\" aria-setsize=\"-1\" data-aria-posinset=\"3\" data-aria-level=\"1\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Weakness, lightheadedness, faintness or sweating for no obvious reason.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Nausea or vomiting and unusual tiredness are possible, too, particularly in women. According to Dr. Colyer, women having a heart attack may also be more likely than men to experience discomfort in their upper abdomen rather than their chest. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">In general, symptoms typically last for more than a few minutes. Surprisingly though, they often come and go — adding to the confusion about what’s happening with your body.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h3>Looking First to the Heart<span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559738&quot;:2,&quot;335559739&quot;:2,&quot;335559745&quot;:1,&quot;335559746&quot;:1}\"> </span></h3>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Sometimes people describe a sharp, electrical shock type feeling in their chest that lasts for only seconds, then disappears. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr. Colyer said something like that is unlikely to be due to a heart problem.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“Heart-related discomfort tends to come on over a little bit of time. It might increase in intensity, reach a peak and then slowly get better,” he explained.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">When discomfort is linked to physical exertion or accompanied by feelings of being out of breath, those clues point to a heart issue, as well. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">If tests reveal your heart is healthy, doctors will look elsewhere to find the cause of your discomfort. There are many possibilities, including anxiety, muscle strain and digestive problems.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“We always want to make sure we check out the heart, and if it turns out it’s not the heart, then we have the luxury of time,” said Dr. Colyer. </span>\n<h2>Quick Treatment Leads to Better Outcomes</h2>\nIf you’re having chest discomfort with other heart attack symptoms, consider it an emergency and call 911 right away.\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“Time is muscle,” explained Dr. Colyer. “If the muscle is deprived of oxygen for a prolonged period of time, it leads to heart muscle dying.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Losing heart muscle can cause permanent heart damage, and in some cases, death. But if you get to the hospital quickly, the better your outcome is likely to be. At ProMedica, we understand that every minute counts. That’s why our goal is to diagnose a heart attack and open the blocked artery within 90 minutes. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Years ago, there was little to do for someone beyond hoping a patient would survive. But, luckily, that’s not the case today. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“There have been so many advances in treating heart attacks over the past 10 or 20 years or more,” said Dr. Colyer. “Now we know that if someone comes in early, their chance of surviving a heart attack and living a full and productive life afterwards is very good.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n<h2>Don’t Be Reluctant to Seek Help</h2>\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">The most important thing to remember is that any time you’re concerned about chest discomfort, you shouldn’t hesitate to get help. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“Err on the side of caution,” said Dr. Colyer. “We want you to come into the emergency department and get checked out.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">Don’t feel embarrassed or that you’re bothering people, even if you’re unsure whether your symptoms are linked to your heart.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<span data-contrast=\"none\">“That’s our job,” said Dr. Colyer about doing an evaluation. “We want to see you so we can treat a heart attack quickly, if that’s what it turned out to be.” </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;335559739&quot;:200}\"> </span>\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/william-colyer-jr-md-facc-cardiology\">William Colyer, Jr., MD, FACC</a>, a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians Cardiology. Learn more about <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/heart-care\">heart care at ProMedica</a>. </em>",

    "Title": "Dispelling Common Sickle Cell Disease Myths",
    "Content": "Sickle cell disease is an inherited red blood cell disorder that causes abnormal hemoglobin called sickle hemoglobin. It is the most common single-gene disorder in the United States and worldwide.\n\nSickle cell disease causes sickle hemoglobin to form long chains, triggering the red blood cells to take on a crescent shape when they release oxygen. These crescent-shaped cells can’t travel through blood vessels well and break down quickly, leading to the most common problems in sickle cell disease: anemia and blockage of the flow of blood in the tissues.\n\nOver time, because of sickling of the red blood cells, patients can also develop chronic organ damage to almost any organ. Bone, kidney, lung and spleen are the most common sites of chronic damage. Currently, there is no cure for sickle cell disease except for a bone marrow transplant.\n\nAbout 100,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with sickle cell disease. One in 13 African Americans carry the sickle cell trait, and many do not know they have it.\n\nDespite it being fairly common, many myths surround sickle cell disease:\n<h2>Myth 1: I am going to catch sickle cell disease from a friend.</h2>\nThis is simply not true. Sickle cell disease is not a virus or infection. You will not catch it from another person. People with sickle cell disease have it because they inherited two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.\n<h2>Myth 2: The sickle cell trait can turn into sickle cell disease.</h2>\nSickle cell disease and the sickle cell trait are two separate things. If a baby only inherits a single sickle cell gene, she or he has the sickle cell trait, but will not develop sickle cell disease. A child must inherit two sickle cell genes to develop the disease. Children of parents who have sickle cell disease are obligate carriers of the gene, and have a 25% chance of having a child with sickle cell disease if he or she has children with someone who has the trait.\n<h2>Myth 3: The patient with sickle cell disease is drug-seeking.</h2>\nThis is likely the most common myth. Sickle cell disease pain is real, and just because patients have learned to distract themselves with their phone or video games or TV, doesn’t make their pain any less real. Individuals with Sickle cell disease should choose providers who are educated about the nature of the pain associated with the disease, so that they can get the relief they need.\n<h2>Myth 4: Sickle cell disease patients are just addicted to their pain medication.</h2>\nAgain, sickle cell disease patients often develop chronic recurrent pain related to their disease, and unfortunately, there are no good studies showing the benefit of alternative therapies for their pain other than narcotics. Their pain needs to be treated adequately. Most patients with sickle cell disease have a far shortened lifespan compared to the general population, living on average to only their mid-forties. However, most patients who can maintain themselves on some degree of disease-modifying antisickling agent tend to do better than others.\n\nWhen babies are little and identified as having sickle cell disease early, providers should take the following course of action:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Family education and counseling,</strong> making sure the family understands the type of disease the patient has and any potential complication risk factors .</li>\n \t<li><strong>Preventive therapy</strong> such as penicillin prophylaxis, immunizations, and appropriate screening (for stroke and other conditions) at the appropriate time.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Disease-modifying therapy</strong> including hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, L-glutamine (5 and over), voxelotor (12 and over), and crizanlizumab (16 and over), all of which provide some degree of relief from acute complications and potentially slows chronic organ damage that occurs in patients with sickle cell disease.</li>\n</ol>\nWhile Sickle cell disease cannot be cured at this time, symptoms can usually be managed with a range of medications, including those that address ongoing chronic pain. These treatments are incredibly important to help sickle cell disease patients improve their quality of life to the extent possible.",

    "Title": "Understanding COVID-19’s Lasting Symptoms",
    "Content": "When you’re sick, there’s nothing you look forward to more than getting better. Suddenly the idea feeling “normal” again is all you can think about, so you hold out hope that your symptoms will subside quickly.\n\nBut for some people who had COVID-19 — about 10 percent according to Brian Kaminski, DO, CPPS, a board-certified emergency medicine physician and vice president of quality and patient safety at ProMedica — symptoms can stick around longer. Referred to as “long-haulers,” these individuals still have symptoms at least four weeks after they first got COVID-19 — and some continue to experience symptoms for far longer.\n<h2>Common Lingering Symptoms</h2>\nEvery person with long-term COVID-19 symptoms may have them for a different amount of time. “Some people haven’t completely recovered and had the infection over a year ago,” says Dr. Kaminski. “While others get a mild version and recover quickly and completely.”\n\nCOVID-19 long-term symptoms can include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Loss of taste and smell. </strong>One of the hallmarks of COVID-19 is that people report a loss of taste and smell, sometimes for six months or more. The majority of people who have that symptom do regain their sense of taste and smell eventually though.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Psychological changes.</strong> Symptoms like anxiety and depression can be long-hauler symptoms that worsen when your physical body isn’t recovering quickly. While you may think of things as physical vs. mental, they are often connected.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Worsening of a condition you already had.</strong> If you had a medical condition before you got COVID-19, your long-term symptoms may be here to stay. For example, COVID-19 symptoms can permanently worsen conditions like dementia, heart disease, COPD, emphysema, congestive heart failure and more.</li>\n</ul>\nOf all your body’s systems, your brain, lungs and heart tend to be most affected by COVID-19. Other long-lasting symptoms may include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Blood clots.</li>\n \t<li>Cough.</li>\n \t<li>Chest pain.</li>\n \t<li>Difficulty focusing and concentrating (“brain fog”).</li>\n \t<li>Dizziness when standing up.</li>\n \t<li>Fatigue.</li>\n \t<li>Faster heart rate.</li>\n \t<li>Headache.</li>\n \t<li>Joint pain.</li>\n \t<li>Memory problems.</li>\n \t<li>Muscle aches.</li>\n \t<li>Shortness of breath.</li>\n \t<li>Sleep disturbances.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A Note on Blood Clots</h3>\nDr. Kaminski believes the media underreports blood clotting with COVID-19. Both adults and children should watch out for symptoms of blood clots, which can develop early on as part of the initial infection or later on as a long-hauler symptom, can be very dangerous.\n\nStroke-like symptoms, such as sudden chest pain or shortness of breath could indicate a blood clot in your lungs. Similarly, a tender, swollen and painful lower leg could indicate a blood clot in your leg. If you have any of these symptoms, <strong>seek emergency medical care immediately.</strong>\n<h3>Concerning Symptoms in Children</h3>\nKids respond differently than adults to coronavirus: Their bodies tend to handle the virus much better since they usually only develop a mild version of the disease. Even so, it’s important to know that children with COVID-19 can also develop long-term complications.\n\nKids who’ve had COVID-19 are also at risk for a rare condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C), which can cause inflammation of the lungs, kidneys, heart, brain, eyes, skin or gastrointestinal organs. While the exact cause of this condition isn’t known, there does seem to be a connection between MIS-C and kids who’ve had COVID-19.\n\n“But it’s very rare to see a case. In fact, MIS-C develops in less than one percent of kids that get COVID-19” says Dr. Kaminski.\n\nStill, it’s a serious condition and can even be deadly. That’s why it’s important to seek medical care if your child shows any signs and to understand that it happens in otherwise healthy children with no underlying medical conditions. Talk with your pediatrician if your child has:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Abdominal pain.</li>\n \t<li>Bloodshot eyes.</li>\n \t<li>Diarrhea.</li>\n \t<li>Difficulty breathing.</li>\n \t<li>Fatigue.</li>\n \t<li>Neck pain.</li>\n \t<li>Persistent fever.</li>\n \t<li>Rash.</li>\n \t<li>Vomiting.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Seek emergency care right away if your child:</strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Complains of chest pain or pressure or severe abdominal pain.</li>\n \t<li>Experiences sudden confusion or disorientation.</li>\n \t<li>Has difficulty breathing.</li>\n \t<li>Is unable to stay awake.</li>\n \t<li>Shows signs of stroke.</li>\n</ul>\nThe good news is, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most children who develop MIS-C but receive medical care to treat it, get better.\n<h2>Handling Long-term Symptoms</h2>\n“Most people are recovering from home,” says Dr. Kaminski. “But if any sudden or severe symptoms come on, such as stroke signs or chest pain, you should seek care immediately at an emergency department.”\n\nIf your symptoms are milder, a visit to your primary care provider is appropriate. And, depending on your symptoms, your primary care doctor may send you to a specialist, like a pulmonologist, to help you with the lingering effects of long haul COVID-19.\n\nTalk to your healthcare provider about your unique situation and symptoms. They can diagnose you and create an individualized care plan.\n\n<em>To find a primary care provider at ProMedica, visit </em><a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/find-a-doctor\"><em>ProMedica.org.</em></a>",

    "Title": "Planning for orthopaedic surgery? Communication is key.",
    "Content": "If surgery is in the near future for you or a loved one, understanding exactly what will happen on surgery day (and the days that follow) will help you best prepare and ensure an easier — and speedier — recovery. No matter the type of surgery you’re facing, a few basics apply. Learn what to expect and do before, during and after your orthopaedic procedure.\n<h2>Understand the Ins and Outs of Your Surgery</h2>\nAt ProMedica, our orthopaedic surgery team works hard to communicate with you every step of the way. With written materials, virtual and in-person patient education classes (like Total Joint Preoperative University) and opportunities for you to meet with your surgeon prior to surgery day, we offer a number of ways to help you feel comfortable and confident going into your procedure.\n\n“Patients need to fully understand their orthopaedic problem, and their surgeon should help,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/anil-k-gupta-md-mba-orthopaedic-surgery\">Anil Gupta, MD, MBA,</a> an orthopaedic surgeon with ProMedica Physicians. “Here, we’ll help you understand your condition, prognosis, procedure and recovery — and will be there for you throughout the entire process.”\n\nWe recommend that you and your surgeon discuss:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Preparation.</li>\n \t<li>Surgery day.</li>\n \t<li>Post-operative care.</li>\n \t<li>Rehabilitation.</li>\n \t<li>Pain management.</li>\n</ul>\n“Some patients have had previous surgery, preexisting conditions like fibromyalgia or have been on medication to manage pain from other issues,” says Dr. Gupta. “And so, it's important to have a post-surgical pain management plan in place prior to surgery.”\n<h2>Prepare Yourself for Surgery and Your Home for Recovery</h2>\nThe instructions you receive before your surgery will depend on your condition and unique circumstances — and that means they can look slightly different for every patient.\n\nIf you are in relatively good health, you may only need to stop food and liquids, usually at midnight, before you come to the hospital. And you may also be asked to stop certain medications. Make sure you follow the specific instructions given by your care team, and to ask questions if you aren’t clear on any of the details.\n\nIf you have additional health conditions, such as a history of heart attacks, stroke or diabetes, you may need:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Additional tests prior to surgery, including an EKG, chest X-ray or blood tests.</li>\n \t<li>An approval from your primary care provider, even if these health concerns are unrelated to your orthopaedic condition or injury.</li>\n \t<li>Assistance with quitting smoking (you should stop at least 4-6 weeks before surgery since smokers have higher rates of orthopaedic surgery failure compared to nonsmokers.</li>\n</ul>\nIf you need additional support, don’t hesitate to reach out to your surgical care team — and should you need help to stop smoking, talk to your doctor about <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/tobacco-cessation\">ProMedica’s Tobacco Cessation</a> program.\n\nAs part of your preparations, you should also decide on a caregiver to help you both at the hospital and when you return home. A trusted family member or friend at your side will go a long way in helping you:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Get around the house as needed.</li>\n \t<li>Keep track of follow-up appointments and recommended next steps.</li>\n \t<li>Maintain your personal hygiene.</li>\n \t<li>Remember your doctor’s instructions and details about how your surgery went.</li>\n \t<li>Stay on track with medications.</li>\n</ul>\nFinally, you will want to prepare your home. Consider things like where it will be easiest for you to rest or sleep and have a clear path to the kitchen and restroom. You may also want to plan several no-prep meals to have on hand as you regain your strength and mobility.\n<h2>Learn What to Expect During Your Surgery or Hospital Stay</h2>\nUnless your surgeon says otherwise, you’ll probably have surgery and go home the same day. “There's a trend toward accelerated recovery and shortened hospital stays, even with total hip, knee, and shoulder replacements,” Dr. Gupta explains, “And patients do well with that.” But every patient is different, and every surgical case is unique. Your care team will make sure you know when you can expect to return home.\n<h3>What to Bring</h3>\nRegardless of whether your procedure is an outpatient procedure or requires a hospital stay, the list of items you’ll need to bring is largely the same. These items include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Advance directive (if you have one).</li>\n \t<li>Comfortable clothes (easy to get on and off, and loose-fitting).</li>\n \t<li>Identification (such as driver’s license or state-issued ID).</li>\n \t<li>Insurance information.</li>\n \t<li>Required payment.</li>\n \t<li>Someone you know to drive you to and from the hospital (use of taxis or ride-hailing services aren’t permitted).</li>\n</ul>\nAnd, although your medications are listed in your electronic health record, it’s a good idea to bring a list of your current prescriptions.\n\nIf an overnight stay is required as part of your surgical plan, you may also want to add these items to your list:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Entertainment (books, puzzles, magazines, tablets, computers).</li>\n \t<li>Glasses (it may be easier not to worry with your contacts).</li>\n \t<li>Hygiene products (hair care, deodorant, skin care, dental care).</li>\n \t<li>Pajamas (loose-fitting is best), undergarments, robe and non-slip socks or slippers.</li>\n \t<li>Phone (and don’t forget your charger!) .</li>\n \t<li>Snack items (unless you will be on a restricted diet).</li>\n</ul>\nYou may also want to consider leaving any valuable items, such as cash, jewelry and computers at home since these items will be left unattended at times. In some cases, lockers and lockable bedside tables are available. Please ask your care team prior to bringing these valuables and be sure that your items will fit in any lockable spaces.\n<h2>Know How to Get the Best Outcome<strong>\n</strong></h2>\nIt’s natural to talk with friends, family and sometimes even strangers about your upcoming surgery. And it’s likely you’ll run across someone who’s had a similar procedure. But while it’s okay to listen to their experiences, it’s important to realize that outcomes vary widely from person to person. Your recovery, pain levels and response to physical therapy may be very different from theirs.\n\n“It's so important to work closely with your care team. You, your family, your doctor and your therapist all need to be on the same page” says Dr. Gupta. That's what will ensure the very best outcome.”\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you think you may be ready for joint replacement surgery, ProMedica’s orthopaedic experts are here to help you stop hurting and start living.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"www.promedica.org/ortho\"] Learn More[/button]</p>",

    "Title": "The Lesser-Known Symptoms of Heart Attacks",
    "Content": "<em>“It was like an elephant sitting on my chest.” </em>\n\n<em>“It hit me like a ton of bricks.”</em>\n\nFor some heart attack patients, their symptoms come on hard and fast. Intense chest pressure. Discomfort in their left arm. Shortness of breath. Sweating. Nausea. But for every patient who feels the classic signs of a heart attack, there’s another who experiences totally different — and sometimes quieter — symptoms.\n<h2>You may not feel severe discomfort.</h2>\nFirst things first: Having a heart attack doesn’t automatically mean you’ll feel chest-clutching pain. Chest pressure you might even rate as a 2 or 3 out of 10, could be a sign of a heart attack if it persists.\n\n“It’s easy to overlook chest pressure when it’s low-grade. But you don’t have to be doubled over in pain. In fact, I’d say most heart attacks aren’t like that,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/rajendra-kattar-md-facc-cardiology\">Raj Kattar, MD,</a> a cardiologist with ProMedica Physicians.\n<h2>Keep an eye on sudden symptoms.</h2>\nSo how can you tell if subtle signs could mean something more? If you suddenly feel one of the following symptoms — especially if it comes along with one or more of the classic heart attack symptoms — you should get medical help right away.\n<h3>Heartburn</h3>\nPeople usually think acid reflux when they feel heartburn. But if it comes on suddenly, is worse than usual and your normal remedies such as antacids don’t work after a few minutes, it could be a sign of a heart attack, especially if you’re also short of breath and sweaty.\n<h3>Indigestion</h3>\nDiscomfort in areas of the body between the chest and belly is often dismissed as indigestion, and that’s a likely cause. However, heart attacks in various areas of the heart can cause indigestion-like symptoms. If you have persistent nausea, vomiting or burping that is accompanied by shortness of breath and sweating, it could be signaling a heart problem.\n<h3>Pain in the Jaw or Between the Shoulder Blades</h3>\nPain that appears out of the blue in one of these areas, especially if it’s very strong or severe, could have a cardiac cause.\n<h3>Shortness of Breath</h3>\nIf you suddenly become short of breath for no reason, take note. On its own or with sweatiness, intense shortness of breath can be an atypical presentation of a heart attack. Doctors see it often in elderly patients who sometimes don’t report significant chest pain.\n\n“If you’re not sure if your mild issue needs urgent attention, a good rule of thumb is to try your normal remedies to see if that helps reduce your discomfort. But if the feeling starts to last 20 or 30 minutes, or you start getting additional symptoms, it’s time to get help,” explains Dr. Kattar.\n<h2>Tell someone how you’re feeling.</h2>\nMake sure to tell someone if you’re feeling a new, sudden symptom. Many mild heart attack patients don’t go to the hospital until a family member urges them to get help. They can also call 911 for you if needed.\n\nIt’s important to get medical help right away, since doctors need to address the problem quickly to reduce permanent heart damage. If you wait, it could lead to issues like congestive heart failure, disability from shortness of breath or dangerous complications down the road.\n\n“A false alarm once in a while is better than missing a heart attack,” says Dr. Kattar. “Sometimes it is just indigestion. But missing a heart attack could have long-term consequences, so I think you’re better off seeking medical attention.”\n\n<em>To learn more about heart care at ProMedica, visit <a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/heart\">ProMedica.org/heart.</a></em>",

    "Title": "When Is It Time for Shoulder, Hip or Knee Replacement Surgery?",
    "Content": "During shoulder, hip or knee replacement surgery, orthopaedic surgeons replace arthritic or damaged joint surfaces with metal, plastic or ceramic parts that function like a normal, healthy joint. But experiencing joint pain alone doesn’t necessarily mean it’s time for a new joint.\n\nLearn when you need total joint replacement surgery for a shoulder, hip or knee; and when it may be better to wait.\n<h2>How Joints Work<strong>\n</strong></h2>\nThere are two types of joints: ball-and-socket joints and hinge joints. The difference between them is how they’re structured and work to allow movement.\n\nBall-and-socket joints, such as hips and shoulders, are shaped just like it sounds. One bone that’s shaped like a ball sits in the curve of another that acts as a socket. With connective tissue joining them together, they work as a system that allows for a broad range of motion. Imagine your shoulder joint giving you the ability to draw a full 360-degree circle in the air with your arms or your hip joint giving you the ability to do the same with your legs.\n\nHinge joints, such as your knee joints, have a smaller range of motion but are, by far, the largest and strongest joints in your body. So, while they only allow one plane with small degrees of motion, they can support a greater amount of force.\n<h2>Understanding Joint Problems<strong>\n</strong></h2>\nJoint problems usually bring people to orthopaedic specialists when the pain begins to affect their ability to carry out normal activities.\n\n“People just get frustrated when they aren’t able to stand, walk or participate in the activities they love,” says <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/karl-j-beer-md-orthopaedic-surgery\">Karl Beer, MD</a>, an orthopaedic surgeon with ProMedica Physicians, “But we’re always ready to help.”\n\nTypically, joint issues fall into two basic categories: arthritis or injury.\n\n<strong>Arthritis</strong> is a progressive condition that damages the cartilage lining sockets of the shoulder, knee or hip, and the ends of the upper arm, thigh and shin bones. Though it usually affects people 50 and older, it can affect younger people, too. As the cartilage wears it causes inflammation, swelling, and pain.  Eventually, you have bone-on-bone contact and end stage disease which results in the need for joint replacement.\n\n<strong>Injury.</strong> Traumatic injuries can result in the need for joint replacement. So can rotator cuff tears, which cause debilitating pain in about 2 million adults in the United States. Left untreated, a torn rotator cuff muscle can atrophy (waste away) and become unrepairable.\n\n“While all joint issues are painful, hips and knees are often worse because they are weight-bearing joints,” Dr. Beer says. “So, hip and knee problems tend to interfere most with quality of life.”\n<h2>When to Have a Joint Replacement<strong>\n</strong></h2>\nSo, how do you know it’s the right time for you to get a new joint? The short answer is that everyone is different. But for most, it’s a matter of when your pain prevents you from managing the activities of daily life or keeps you from doing the things that matter most to you.\n\n“Hip arthritis especially, can cause people to lose mobility to the point where they have trouble with simple things like putting their shoes and socks on. And in many cases, they can't even reach their foot,” says Dr. Beer. “So, we do surgery to relieve progressive pain and loss of motion in the joint, so they can get back to living their best life.”\n\nBut joint replacement surgery shouldn’t be rushed. Although modern joint replacement surgery is very successful, any type of surgery has risk of complications. These include infection, fractures around the joint and the long-term consequences of wear or loosening — not to mention recovery, which usually takes weeks and may include physical therapy. Your best bet is to wait until nonsurgical treatments, such as medication, injections, and physical therapy, no longer manage your symptoms and your X-rays show the joint has deteriorated.\n\n“With hips or knees, for example, it makes more sense not to replace them until you absolutely have to,” says Dr. Beer. “Then, you know the benefits outweigh the risks.”\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>If you think you may be ready for joint replacement surgery, ProMedica’s orthopaedic experts are here to help you stop hurting and start living.</em></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"www.promedica.org/ortho\"] Learn More[/button]</p>",

    "Title": "Cancer Screenings: Get Them While You Feel Great",
    "Content": "Cancer screenings are down due to the pandemic across our system, across the state and across the country. Unfortunately, the data clearly shows that skipping cancer screenings results in more initial diagnoses of advanced cancer.\n\nCancer screenings are incredibly important. Instead of going to your healthcare provider when you have symptoms, cancer screenings detect any changes in your body before you feel symptoms. That’s why the best time for someone to get screened is when they are feeling great with no symptoms. Once someone has symptoms, we are no longer talking about screenings and instead talking about diagnostic procedures.\n\nIn general with cancer, no matter how aggressive the cancer is, if it's caught in an early stage, it can be cured. It’s really important to discuss with your health care provider the best screening schedule for you based on your family history and other risk factors. The main cancer screenings detect, and in some cases prevent, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer.\n\nThe following symptoms can be a strong indication of cancer and medical attention should be sought quickly:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Breast cancer – masses, lumps, tenderness or nipple discharge.</li>\n \t<li>Colon cancer – gastrointestinal issues, cramping or bleeding with bowel movements.</li>\n \t<li>Cervical cancer - a heavy menstrual cycle, pain or bleeding after intercourse.</li>\n \t<li>Prostate cancer – difficulty urinating, urinating frequently and urine retention.</li>\n \t<li>Lung cancer – persistent coughing.</li>\n</ul>\nIt is safe to get your screenings since health care facilities take extra measures to help ensure clean and sanitized environments. Getting your screening is something that could certainly change the course of your life. There are plenty of COVID-19 protocols put in place, such as getting COVID-19 testing 24 to 48 hours before any procedure, consistent monitoring and vaccine availability.\n\nThe best cancer screening programs include services to make sure they are accessible to all. Those services may include assistance with transportation or other barriers that might make it difficult for someone to access cancer screenings.  It is so important to have conversations with your health care providers. Everyone should feel empowered to take charge of their health care and improve their health and well-being.\n<h2>Cancer Screening Guidelines</h2>\n<h3>Breast Cancer:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Women in their 20s and 30s: breast exam at least every three years.</li>\n \t<li>Women ages 40 and older: an annual breast exam and an annual mammogram.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cervical Cancer:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Women ages 21 to 29: Pap test every three years.</li>\n \t<li>Women ages 30 to 65: Pap test every three years OR combined Pap test and HPV tests every five years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Colorectal Cancer:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Men and women ages 45 and older: begin screening and then have a colonoscopy every 10 years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Prostate Cancer:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Men age 40: talk with your doctor to make an informed decision on testing based on personal risk factors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Lung Cancer:</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Men and women ages 50 to 80 with a high risk of lung cancer: ask your doctor if you could benefit from a lung cancer screening.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Learn more about cancer screenings and cancer care at ProMedica.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/cancer/?#screening\"] Learn More [/button]</p>",

    "Content": "Some people are familiar with occasional ringing in the ears that comes after long exposure to loud sounds, such as a concert. However, those with a condition called tinnitus must live with that ringing 24 hours a day.\n\n“Tinnitus is really the perception of sound when there is no external source for the sound,” said Tracy Tunis, F-AAA, an audiologist with ProMedica Physicians Ear, Nose and Throat. “In other words, an individual is hearing something and it’s not occurring anywhere in the environment.”\n\nGenerally, tinnitus is caused by a change in someone’s body – be it physical or mental.

    "Title": "Caring for Summer Skin Allergies: Bites, Stings and Rashes",
    "Content": "Nights at the fire pit fending off pesky mosquitos. Long days of yard work that end in a bad case of poison ivy. Family play time that results in a dreaded sting. With summer comes many things that can cause allergic skin reactions, like bugs, plants and the sun. From bites and rashes to serious bee, wasp and hornet stings, knowing how to treat these common summer skin reactions will go a long way in helping you stay comfortable and safe all season long.\n<h2>Bee, Wasp and Hornet Stings</h2>\nStings are uncomfortable for everyone. Whether you experience minor symptoms, such as a burning sensation, itching or swelling, or more serious ones like the swelling of your throat and tongue, we’re all on high alert when we see a bee, wasp or hornet.\n\n“When most people get stung, they may experience pain at the sting site, redness and swelling. These reactions are generally what we call local reactions,” explains <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/marwa-el-bohy-md-allergy-and-immunology\">Marwa El Bohy, MD,</a> an allergy and immunology specialist with ProMedica Physicians. “For example, if you’re stung on the finger and your hand swells up, that’s still considered a local reaction because it is contiguous with the site of the sting.”\n\nHowever, when your body’s response to a sting creates more than a local reaction, and affects your ability to breathe and function, <strong>you need emergency treatment.</strong> ER doctors are specially trained to recognize the signs of anaphylaxis (a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction), including:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Chest tightening.</li>\n \t<li>Confusion.</li>\n \t<li>Coughing.</li>\n \t<li>Difficulty breathing.</li>\n \t<li>Difficulty swallowing.</li>\n \t<li>Dizziness.</li>\n \t<li>Lightheadedness.</li>\n \t<li>Lip swelling.</li>\n \t<li>Nausea.</li>\n \t<li>Passing out.</li>\n \t<li>Tongue swelling.</li>\n \t<li>Hives.</li>\n \t<li>Flushing.</li>\n \t<li>Itching.</li>\n</ul>\n“There are several types of allergic reactions that may occur upon exposure to a known allergen or trigger. Anaphylaxis represents the most severe type of reaction and usually involves at least two organ systems or isolated involvement of the respiratory or cardiovascular systems,” Dr. El Bohy notes. “So, hives and vomiting or lip swelling and difficulty breathing, for example, would be diagnosed as anaphylaxis since two organ systems are involved. <strong>Anytime you experience respiratory or cardiovascular distress, you should go to the ER.” </strong>\n\nFor those who experience systemic reactions to a sting or severe swelling, referral to an allergist for venom testing and possibly immunotherapy is important. Venom immunotherapy can be a life-saving treatment to prevent or mitigate risk of future reactions.\n\nThose who’ve been stung many times with progressively larger local reactions should see an allergist to discuss venom therapy, as well, especially if they have a high risk of exposure, such as landscapers, gardeners or beekeepers.\n\nAnother important tip from Dr. El Bohy: “If a stinger is left in your skin, remove it by scraping it with a fingernail or credit card. But do not use tweezers to pull it out. Venom can be left in the stinger and if you squeeze it, you can release more venom and worsen the reaction.”\n<h2>Mosquito Bites</h2>\nWhile mosquito bites can be annoying, very rarely do they cause severe allergic reactions like bee stings. Mosquito saliva, which is made of as many as 30 different proteins, is what makes us allergic to mosquito bites — and reactions vary widely from person to person.\n\nFortunately, you can use over-the-counter remedies to treat mosquito bites. And these same remedies can be used for mild bee stings:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</li>\n \t<li>Antihistamine.</li>\n \t<li>Anti-itch and cortisone cream (1% to 2% is sold over the counter).</li>\n \t<li>Calamine lotion.</li>\n \t<li>Ice for swelling.</li>\n</ul>\nSpraying your body and clothes with insect repellant containing 20% to 30% DEET is the most effective way to keep mosquitoes away. Parents can use the spray on kids as long as they’re older than two months.\n\nAfter that, avoid mosquito bites by:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Wearing long sleeves, pants and closed-toe shoes whenever possible.</li>\n \t<li>Emptying standing water.</li>\n \t<li>Trying bug-repellant wrist bands, citronella candles and mosquito-repellant plants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Plants and Rashes</h2>\nPoison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac can cause itchy rashes because of an oil they contain called urushiol. Properly identifying these plants and avoidance is one of the best ways to avoid a potential reaction. Poison ivy or poison oak have red stems and leaves in groups of three arising from a single stem. Poison sumac may have five to seven or more leaves.  All species may have black dots on it from the urushiol oil that has been oxidized after exposure to oxygen.\n\nIf you come in contact with any of these plants, be sure to wash yourself and your clothes right away. Getting the urushiol off your skin is key to stopping the spread and calming the rash. You can also try:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Applying anti-itch or hydrocortisone cream.</li>\n \t<li>Soaking in an oatmeal bath.</li>\n \t<li>Taking an antihistamine.</li>\n \t<li>Using calamine lotion.</li>\n</ul>\nYou may need to see a healthcare provider to get a more potent topical steroid or an oral steroid if the rash persists.\n\nOne last note: It’s a common misconception that scratching the rash and then touching another part of your body can spread it. But that’s not the case. Only the oil itself, not your blister fluid, can spread the rash. Touching your face, arms, legs or feet, however, before you realize the oil is on you, is the problem.\n<h2>Rashes and the Sun</h2>\nSeparate from an actual sunburn, there are several types of rashes that may occur with sun exposure, often described as a “sun allergy”.  This may occur even if you’re only in the sun for a short period of time (30 minutes to a few hours). You may have an increased risk of developing this type of a reaction if you are taking certain medications, such as antibiotics, which make you photosensitive.\n\nThese rashes, which are red and very itchy, typically occur on any sun-exposed areas of your body. The good news is that these rashes typically resolve with just supportive care at home. “The key is avoidance and appropriate use of sun protection as primary means of prevention and ultimately staying out of the sun so your skin can heal,” says Dr. El Bohy.\n\n<em>To learn more about allergies and allergy care at ProMedica, visit </em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/allergies\"><em>ProMedica.org</em></a><em>.</em>",

    "Title": "Cancer Survivorship Program Offers Healing and Hope",
    "Content": "If all goes according to plan, 65-year-old Julie Bair could be participating in a 5K race later this year. For most people that’s impressive, but in Julie’s case, it’s beyond impressive.\n\nJust two years ago, Julie was in intensive care, fighting for her life. She’d been diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma in 2018. A fist-sized mass sitting on her lung had grown around her superior vena cava, the large vein that brings deoxygenated blood back to the heart.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"8\" sm=\"8\" xs=\"12\"]\n\nWhen multiple chemotherapy regimens failed, her ProMedica doctors recommended a stem cell transplant. So, she traveled to Ohio State University’s Arthur James Cancer Hospital, one of the select facilities to offer the treatment. The day after her transplant, Julie was found unresponsive and had to be put on a ventilator. It was touch and go for some time, but she survived. After that experience, Julie became so weak, that she was unable to walk.\n\n“I literally felt like I was looking at the gates of hell,” she says. But after six weeks in the hospital, months of additional chemotherapy, radiation, dialysis and finally, immunotherapy, doctors declared her cancer in remission in March 2021.\n\nJulie is a survivor. And now, as a participant in ProMedica’s Couch to 5K Program, a service of the health system’s Cancer Survivorship Program, we may soon be calling her a 5K winner as well, regardless of her finishing position.\n\n[/column]\n[column md=\"4\" sm=\"4\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-8117 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Julie-Bair-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[/row]\n<h2>Meeting Patient Needs</h2>\nIt’s for people like Julie that the Cancer Survivorship Program exists.\n\n“The goal of the program is to help someone who’s been given a cancer diagnosis live as fully as possible, and have the best quality of life as possible,” says Lisa Hartkopf Smith, APRN.CNS, MS, AOCN, CHPN, an advanced practice oncology nurse, who coordinates the ProMedica Cancer Institute Survivorship Program.\n\nEveryone’s cancer is unique. But in almost all cases, the disease is life changing. People may have physical challenges related to their cancer or its treatment, and many experience emotional challenges as well.\n\nAnxiety about cancer returning is their top concern, Hartkopf Smith says. But worries about getting new cancers care common, too. And it’s not unusual for people to feel guilty that they’ve survived cancer, when others may have died.\n\nThe program, which is typically covered by insurance, meets patients where they’re at, offering personalized guidance and services that help them return to day-to-day living. Self-referrals and provider referrals are welcome.\n<h2>Specialized Care</h2>\nAnyone who’s completed active cancer treatment is eligible. However, the Couch to 5K Program, which is an eight-week class designed to improve patients’ fitness levels, is open to people at any stage of their cancer journey. And patients aren’t required to have received treatment at ProMedica to take part in any Survivorship Program services.\n\nTo start, participants meet with an advanced practice oncology nurse, who will review their medical history. Together, they then develop a plan for monitoring for possible recurrence and to watch for new cancers. They also discuss — and if necessary, make referrals for —ProMedica services that can help them manage the physical, emotional and social effects of cancer and improve their overall health.\n\nSome patients opt for a one-time visit. But many return indefinitely for ongoing follow-up care. In all cases, our program staff works closely with the patient’s oncologist.\n\nAs part of the initial visit, certified oncology dietitians and social workers also meet with the patient. With the advanced practice oncology nurse, that makes three dedicated cancer specialists offering patients assistance.\n\n“That may seem like a common thing, but it’s not,” Hartkopf Smith says. “We’re unique in that regard.”\n<h2>Something for Everyone</h2>\nThe program offers many free classes and webinars, as well as other exercise-related services. It also connects survivors to:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Cancer rehabilitation</li>\n \t<li>Cardio-Oncology Clinic</li>\n \t<li>Financial counseling</li>\n \t<li>Genetic counseling</li>\n \t<li>Healing care (aromatherapy, guided imagery, relaxation, meditation)</li>\n \t<li>Lymphedema therapy</li>\n \t<li>Speech therapy</li>\n \t<li>Women’s Cancer Sexual Health Program</li>\n</ul>\nThere’s something or someone to help with any cancer-related need.\n\n“There’s so much you can do to get back to normal or your new normal and to have the quality of life you want,” says Hartkopf Smith.\n<h2>Hope is Strong Medicine</h2>\nFor patients like Julie, Survivorship Program services, such as Couch to 5K, have been invaluable.\n\n“They help you let go of some of the anxiety — and potentially, despair— so you can regain your hope,” she says.\n\nHer cancer isn’t completely gone, and she’s still on immunotherapy. But right now, her tumors aren’t growing. She’s thankful for the love and care of her husband, other family and friends, and the health care providers at ProMedica and OSU for getting her where she is today: Focused on living each day to the fullest (and maybe even running or walking that 5K).\n\n“No one knows what the future may hold, so it’s living for today that matters,” she shares. “Where there’s life, there’s hope.”\n<h2>Celebrate Survivors</h2>\nJune is National Cancer Survivor Month, a time to celebrate Julie and all others who are living life to the fullest after a cancer diagnosis.\n\n<em>To learn more about ProMedica’s Cancer Survivorship Program, visit <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/services-and-conditions/cancer-survivorship\">ProMedica's website</a> or call 419-824-1952.</em>",

    "Content": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated process that causes an abnormal response directed towards the central nervous system. It can cause a disruption of information within the brain and/or between the brain and spinal cord.\n\nMore than one million people in the United States live with MS. Knowing common signs and symptoms, at-risk demographics and treatment options for MS can help the community better understand and help others diagnosed with the disease.\n\nCommon symptoms of MS include:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Numbness or tingling.</li>\n \t<li>Muscle weakness.</li>\n \t<li>Vision problems such as eye pain or unusual eye movements.</li>\n \t<li>Dizziness.</li>\n \t<li>Difficulty speaking or walking.</li>\n \t<li>Incontinence.</li>\n \t<li>Temperature sensitivity.</li>\n \t<li>Brain fog.</li>\n</ul>\nNot everyone with MS will experience all of the symptoms listed. These symptoms are also associated with diseases other than MS, so it is important to check with a medical provider to determine the cause of the symptoms.\n\nThe cause of MS is unknown, yet, experts believe different genetic and environmental factors can increase one’s chances of developing the disease. For example, women are three times more likely to develop MS compared to men. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, this suggests that hormones may play a role in who is most susceptible to MS. Other at-risk demographics include those who live in locations farthest from the equator, are between 20-50 years of age, experienced obesity in childhood and adolescence and have low vitamin D levels in their blood.\n\nThose diagnosed with MS should communicate with their medical expert to discuss medication options. Medications are used to help modify the disease course, treat relapses and manage symptoms. They are also encouraged to implement healthy lifestyle habits such as not smoking and weight management practices.\n\nMS looks and behaves differently in everyone. Whether you have been diagnosed or a loved one, having the general knowledge of how the disease may affect someone can help you better navigate life with MS.\n\n<em>Shelly Lehmann is an advanced practice registered nurse with ProMedica Physicians Family Medicine in Fremont, Ohio.

    "Title": "Recognizing the Signs of a Stroke",
    "Content": "In the United States, a person has a stroke every 40 seconds. Knowing the signs of a stroke can help ensure life-saving care when minutes matter most.\n\n“The word stroke is the common term for cerebral or cerebellar infarction, which is the death of brain tissue by lack of oxygen,” said Mark Loomus, MD, a neurologist with ProMedica Physicians. “The longer a brain is deprived of oxygen, the less chance for recovery. That’s why it’s absolutely necessary to begin treatment for a stroke as soon as possible.”\n<h2>Signs of a Stroke</h2>\nWhen someone has a stroke, the symptoms show up quickly. “There’s a sudden onset of neurological deficit, such as paralysis, numbness, or loss of vision on one side of the body,” said Dr. Loomus. Other signs could be sudden onset of imbalance, vertigo, double vision or an inability to communicate. A sudden, severe, or unusual headache (like a thunderclap) could be a sign of a bleeding, or hemorrhagic, stroke.\n\nWatch the video below to learn more about recognizing a stroke quickly:\n\n<iframe title=\"YouTube video player\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vGZukepZpCg\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n<h2>What to Do When Someone Has a Stroke</h2>\nIf you think that you or someone you know may be having a stroke, Dr. Loomus recommends that you:\n<ol>\n \t<li>Stay as calm as possible. Try not to panic.</li>\n \t<li>Have the person sit down, but keep their head somewhat elevated.</li>\n \t<li>Call 911 and unlock the front door. Put pets, such as dogs, out of the way and into a closed room.</li>\n \t<li>Do not give the person food or water, as their ability to swallow may be impaired.</li>\n \t<li>Do not let the person fall asleep.</li>\n \t<li>Do not drive yourself or drive the person to the ER. EMTs can assess the situation better, start therapy if needed and even call the ER ahead of time to let them know they’re coming.</li>\n</ol>\n<em>Learn more about stroke and stroke care at </em><a href=\"http://www.promedica.org/stroke\"><em>www.promedica.org/stroke</em></a><em>. </em>",

    "Content": "At 49, Ed Ottensman considered himself active and healthy. He had some minor digestive issues that he shared with his primary care provider. He was referred to <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/peter-klein-md-colorectal-surgery\">Peter Klein, MD,</a> ProMedica Physicians Colorectal Surgery, for a colonoscopy.\n\nThe colonoscopy discovered a cancerous tumor. For the next 14 months, Ed underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatments as well as two surgeries, the first of which was nine hours long.\n\nToday, Ed is back to work full time and cancer-free. He is encouraging others to get their screenings.\n\n“I wish I would have been checked out earlier. I know people have reservations about getting a colonoscopy but I’m here to tell you that pales in comparison to big surgeries and cancer treatments,” said Ed.\n\nColorectal cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in men and women combined in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 1 in 3 adults who need to be screened are actually doing it.\n\nAdditionally, the Colorectal Cancer Alliance sites data that young-onset of colorectal cancer is still on the rise. The rates for people aged 55 or over dropped by 3.6% each year from 2007- 2016. Conversely, the rates for people under 55 increased 2% each year from 2007- 2016.\n\n“We are starting to screen people younger and the American Cancer Society now recommends that all men and women have a colonoscopy starting at age 45 and especially if they have a family history of colon cancer,” said Dr. Klein. “If that had been the recommendation years ago, hopefully, we would have caught Ed’s case before it turned to cancer.”\n\n90 percent of colon cancer cases could be prevented if people were screened at the appropriate time. It is important to talk to your doctor and insurance provider about the best schedule for you. They can help evaluate your family history and risk factors.\n\nA colonoscopy is not only a cancer screening but it also serves as an opportunity for polyps to be identified and removed immediately, preventing a possible colorectal cancer diagnosis. If a polyp is large enough, tissue can be taken and sent for biopsy to determine the exact type of polyp.\n\nDr. Klein also stresses the importance of prevention, “While colon cancer is the third cause of cancer death, it can largely be prevented. Research shows that eating well, getting your exercise, knowing your family history and avoiding alcohol and cigarettes significantly decrease your chances of a colon cancer diagnosis.”\n\nHear Ed share his story with NBC 24:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZiLdXyOt6oY?start=6\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Don't delay your colonoscopy!</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"www.promedica.org/colonoscopy\"] Schedule Yours Today [/button]</p>",

    "Title": "Cologuard or Colonoscopy: Which one should I choose?",
    "Content": "There have been several TV commercials about Cologuard®, a colon cancer screening test. The ad says Cologuard is easy to use, noninvasive and can be completed in the privacy of your own home. The test detects certain DNA markers and blood in stool, which are associated with the possibility of colon cancer or precancer. But should it be used in place of a traditional colonoscopy?\n<h2>Traditional Colonoscopy</h2>\nWhen detected early enough, colon cancer is preventable and treatable. Diagnosis in an early stage usually means a better prognosis and chance of survival. Colonoscopies are considered the gold standard because they can detect cancer <em>and </em>precancer.\n\nDuring a colonoscopy, a provider looks for polyps, or growths. These growths may be removed during the procedure, so they don't have the chance to develop into cancer. So why don't people have a colonoscopy if it's the gold standard?\n\nNegative comments about colonoscopy preparation can make people reluctant to sign up. Stories about drinking gallons of an awful tasting liquid are daunting. But in recent years, the taste and amount of the liquid prep needed has improved.\n\nIt is also much easier to get a colonoscopy when the provider is part of an open access colonoscopy program. This allows healthy people to schedule a screening colonoscopy without the inconvenience of an initial office visit. Patients save both time and cost of an office co-payment. To qualify, you must be age 50 or older with an average risk for colon cancer.\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of a traditional colonoscopy.\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Gold standard for detection of all cancerous and precancerous lesions.</li>\n \t<li>Considered the best test for prevention of colorectal cancer and related deaths.</li>\n \t<li>The doctor can view the entire colon and rectum.</li>\n \t<li>Abnormal tissue, such as polyps, and tissue samples (biopsies) can be removed through the scope during the exam.</li>\n \t<li>Covered by Medicare and is less expensive than Cologuard every three years.</li>\n \t<li>Needed only every 10 years in average risk patients if no polyps are found on initial examination.</li>\n \t<li>Only acceptable test in symptomatic patients (e.g. Iron deficiency anemia, bleeding, change in bowel habits).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Invasive.</li>\n \t<li>Requires bowel preparation.</li>\n \t<li>Requires a provider and procedure appointment.</li>\n \t<li>Patient receives sedation.</li>\n \t<li>Very small risk of complication.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Cologuard</h2>\nCologuard doesn’t require any kind of preparation. There are no dietary or medication restrictions, no laxative preparation, no sedation and no time away from home or work. But there are some downsides to consider.\n\nIf you test positive with Cologuard (or any kind of stool-based screening method), you will need further evaluation. Most of the time, this means needing a diagnostic colonoscopy.\n\nAccording to Cologuard's website, the Cologuard test result should be interpreted with caution. A positive test result does not confirm the presence of cancer. Patients with a positive test result should be referred for diagnostic colonoscopy. A negative test result does not confirm the absence of cancer. Patients with a negative test result should discuss with their doctor when they need to be tested again.\n\nFalse positives and false negative results can also occur. In a clinical study, 13% of people without cancer received a positive result (false positive). In that same study, 8% of people with cancer received a negative result (false negative).\n\nHere are some of the pros and cons of using the at-home screening test Cologuard.\n<h3>Pros</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Non-invasive.</li>\n \t<li>No bowel preparation needed.</li>\n \t<li>Convenient, with no appointment or preparation needed.</li>\n \t<li>Covered by Medicare.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Cons</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li>May miss up to 8% of colorectal cancer.</li>\n \t<li>May miss up to 58% of advanced polyps.</li>\n \t<li>Has a 13% false positive rate, which increases with age.</li>\n \t<li>Required every 3 years, which may make it harder to remember or comply.</li>\n \t<li>Considered a 2nd tier test, offered only if a colonoscopy or annual FIT is refused.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Colon Cancer Prevention</h2>\nColon cancer has a 90% survival rate when detected in early stages. Any efforts to increase participation rates in cancer screenings should be supported, but not all screening is equal. While at-home tests offer convenience and lower cost, traditional colonoscopies are the gold standard for detection and prevention.\n\nThe American Cancer Society recommends that those 45 or older talk to their doctor about screening options. Also, talk with your insurance company about coverage. It’s important to get tested as often as recommended. No matter what your age, talk to your doctor about your family medical history. People at higher risk for colorectal cancer because of family history or certain health conditions might need to start screening earlier than age 45.\n\nIn addition to getting recommended screenings, a healthy diet, exercise and avoiding tobacco can help protect you from colon cancer.\n\n<em><a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/muhannad-heif-md-gastroenterology\">Muhannad Heif, MD,</a> is a board-certified gastroenterologist with ProMedica Physicians Digestive Healthcare.

    "Title": "Treating Your Varicose Veins for Summer-Ready Legs",
    "Content": "As people age, many grow concerned about the appearance of varicose veins in their legs. If you're interested in treating your varicose veins, now is a good time so that they can recover by summer. Here are some things to know and consider.\n<h2>Why do varicose veins occur?</h2>\nArteries carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body, while veins are responsible for getting blood back to the heart. Veins defy gravity to ensure blood does not flow back down to the legs. But when they are damaged or weakened, it causes blood to flow downward. If this happens, veins can become widened or twisted. This gives them a more noticeable appearance.\n<h2>What can increase the chances of developing varicose veins?</h2>\nDamaged or weakened veins is the most common way someone develops varicose veins. Many conditions can lead to this, but the majority include having excess pressure on the abdomen and legs. This includes obesity, pregnancy and standing on your legs for prolonged periods.\n\nGenetics and hormones can also play a role in the development of varicose veins. They are more likely to occur in women because of the changes women endure in a lifetime. Pre-menstruation, menopause, hormonal treatments and birth control can cause the vein walls to relax, making them weak and prone to damage.\n<h2>Can varicose veins be life-threatening?</h2>\nTypically, varicose veins do not pose a major health concern. However, they can cause aching pains, swelling, itching, throbbing or discoloration around the infected area. In some cases, a blood clot can develop in varicose veins. This may cause persistent pain and swelling in the vein and warrants medical attention.\n<h2>Are there ways to prevent or help treat varicose veins at home?</h2>\nLiving an active lifestyle, losing weight, elevating your legs, and avoiding sitting and standing for extended times can help ease pain or prevent varicose veins from worsening. A second at-home prevention or alleviation technique is to wear compression garments during the day. The squeezing sensation helps your calf muscle move blood in an upwards motion more effectively. If these things don't result in the desired outcome, it's time to seek medical attention.\n<h2>What medical treatments are available for those diagnosed?</h2>\nSeveral options are available to those seeking medical treatment of their varicose veins. They include:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Sclerotherapy:</strong> the injection of medications to close off the affected vein(s).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Catheter-assisted Ablation:</strong> use of a laser or radiofrequency through a catheter to seal the vein(s) shut.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Mechanical or Chemical Ablation:</strong> use of non-thermal technology to close off the vein(s).</li>\n \t<li><strong>Vein Ligation and/or Vein Stripping:</strong> tying off an infected vein, and in extreme cases, removing the vein through small incisions.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Ambulatory Phlebectomy:</strong> removing tiny varicose vein(s) through small incisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is recovery like for medical treatments for varicose veins?</h2>\nMedical treatments for varicose veins are outpatient procedures that need little to no downtime. This varies by procedure, but none of the treatments outlined above will restrict daily activity. Some of the treatments require patients to wear compression garments to help with healing. This usually lasts a few weeks after the procedure.\n\nIf varicose veins affect how you look or feel, there are many treatment options available. Winter is an ideal time for many to explore those options.\n\n<em>Dr. Asava-Aree is a ProMedica physician specializing in vascular medicine with Jobst Vascular Institute.</em>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Show your legs some love with a free a screening from Jobst Vascular Institute.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">[button type=\"success\" size=\"lg\" link=\"https://www.promedica.org/yourhealth/veincare/varicose-and-spider-veins-sll/\"] Schedule a Free Screening [/button]</p>",

In acupuncture theory, it is believed that cold can constrict the flow through joints and muscles, making them feel more achy. Think about what happens when you put water in the cold freezer. It constricts into a hard block of ice. In a similar way, cold may restrict flow through the muscles and joints by tightening them up, leading to more aches and pains in some people.\n\nIf you feel your joints tightening as the temperature drops, here are six ideas that may help reduce pain and improve mobility. If aches and pains persist for an extended period of time, please consult your physician.\n<h2>1. Warm up.</h2>\nTry to avoid being outside in the cold for long periods to keep joints warm. If you need to be out in the cold, wear extra layers especially over sore joints to protect them from cold temperatures. Also, warming the joints before and after cold exposure with a heating pad could help increase circulation to help with joint pain. If you’re feeling a chill from being outside, warm up from the inside out with a hot cup of tea.\n<h2>2. Stretch out.</h2>\nWhen muscles and joints feel tight and tense in the cold weather, gentle stretching can be helpful. Stretching before activity can help protect muscles from possible injuries. Shoveling snow and scraping ice off our vehicles in the winter can be hard on our bodies and could lead to muscle strains and injuries. Stretching and also being aware of body mechanics/posture during these types of activities can help prevent injuries. Starting the day with a gentle stretching routine can help warm up our stiff muscles and joints to prepare for the day.\n<h2>3. Soak aches away.</h2>\nSoaking in a bathtub is soothing to both body and mind after a long day. Adding in bath salts could make your relaxing bath more therapeutic. Bath salts contain minerals such as magnesium, which can help relax sore muscles. Magnesium is needed for muscle function and can calm the nervous system so a bath in the evening could help you get a good night’s sleep. Also, the warmth of a bath can help increase circulation through joints and muscles, which can be helpful for aches and pains. Essential oils can also be added to the bath to help ease away the stress and tension from the day.\n<h2>4. Apply a topical.</h2>\nIf muscles and joints are still feeling achy, maybe a topical ointment or linament could help. Topicals can be thick and lotion-like, such as an ointment, or thin and either oil- or water-based such as a linament. These topicals are applied on the skin over sore areas and many contain aromatics such as mint, cinnamon, clove, and lavender.\n\nThese natural aromatic herbs have properties that may help increase circulation to an area, which can be helpful for pain.  The aromatics in topicals can make the topical feel warm, cool or give a tingling sensation when applied. DIY topicals can be made by blending aromatic essential oils into your favorite skincare product, such as lotion or body oil. Be sure to check the ingredient list for allergens before trying a topical. It’s also a good idea to apply to a small area first to make sure you don’t have a reaction.\n<h2>5. Add turmeric.</h2>\nTurmeric is a bright yellow spice that is warm and bright in both color and function. Turmeric has been included in cooking for its flavor but also its therapeutic properties. This spice is believed to have anti-inflammatory properties and help alleviate pain by increasing circulation. You can add this spice to your cooking and it can also be found in supplement form.  A delicious and warming way to use turmeric is a recipe called “golden milk” where turmeric is added to warm milk/milk substitute and can also add honey or cinnamon to taste. Before trying turmeric, talk with you primary care provider to make sure it’s a good fit for you and to ask about any health concerns.\n<h2>6. Try Moxibustion</h2>\nMoxibustion, aka Moxa, is a technique that has been used for centuries to warm painful areas like joints, and should only be performed by a licensed practitioner. An herb called Mugwort is used in this technique and is often pressed or rolled into an incense-like stick. You may have seen Mugwort growing wild in our area and didn’t know about this special plant! This herb is used for its deeply warming properties. During Moxa, this herb is burned safely over the skin at painful areas like joints.\n\nMoxibustion is believed to increase circulation and blood flow to painful areas to aide in pain relief. It could be used for joint pain and also conditions such as neuropathy and cold hands or feet. Moxibustion is performed by a licensed practitioner to ensure safety of the technique and to make sure that the moxibustion is right for you.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CejN5Vxp0TA\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"2 sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7682 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Kylie_Professional-Photo3-267x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"267\" height=\"300\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Kylie A.

    "Title": "Taking Care of Yourself During Cancer Treatment",
    "Content": "Getting a cancer diagnosis is a lot to handle. If you’ve been diagnosed, remember that as you work with your oncologist and care team on your treatment plan, it’s important to take care of yourself in other ways, too. You are a whole person and not just a cancer diagnosis. Taking care of yourself is good for your overall well-being and may support your strength and wellness during your cancer journey.\n\nThis article offers some ideas about caring for yourself during cancer treatment that may help some people. Your medical/surgical oncology team should coordinate your cancer treatment. Please consult them before making any significant diet changes or undergoing new therapies.\n<h2>Eat Well for Well-being</h2>\nNutrition is important to keep your body strong and healthy during your cancer treatment. It may be difficult to eat due to digestive upset, nausea, and a lack of or change in taste during treatments such as chemotherapy. Shakes, soups and stews are easy to digest and can provide a lot of nourishment. It can be hard to find the energy to cook, so making large batches of soups and shakes and then freezing them down into individual portions can make it easy to eat well on the days you’re feeling fatigued.\n\nSense of taste can change for some people during oncology treatment as well. Some say they experience a bitter or bland taste in their mouth and many say they can only taste sweet flavors. This change of taste paired with nausea can make it difficult to eat. And eating only sweets is tasty but doesn’t give you the nourishment you need. There are tablets that contain a natural fruit called Miracle Berry or Miracle Fruit that may be helpful for taste. Miracle Berry is a small red fruit that grows in tropical areas. This incredible fruit may make foods taste sweet and may make it easier for you to eat. These fruit tablets may even make sour and tart foods taste sweet!\n<h2>Trying Natural Ways to Cope with Nausea</h2>\nNausea is a side effect experienced by many as they undergo chemotherapy. Smelling essential oils like peppermint or ginger, or sipping on mint or ginger herbal tea may have a calming effect on the stomach. Some people may also benefit from a natural acupressure wrist band, which applies gentle pressure to an acupuncture point on the wrist.\n<h2>Get Moving to Fight Fatigue</h2>\nFatigue, joint pain and numbness or burning of the hands and feet can also be common side effects of oncology treatment. Gentle movement may help combat these symptoms and help you to feel less fatigued. Even just a few minutes of gentle activity can be helpful. Consider taking a walk, a bicycle ride or adding gentle stretching into your daily routine. Research studies suggest that time spent in nature or the outdoors can help support our immune systems, so that’s another great reason to get outside when you can.\n<h2>Find Ways to Manage Stress</h2>\nIt can be stressful as you embark on your oncology journey. Finding ways to manage stress is important for your overall well-being, mood and immune system. Stress can have many negative effects on health and may affect our immune system by altering hormones in our bodies. There are many natural and simple ways to help manage stress. Deep breathing exercises and smelling of essential oils may be helpful. Your oncology support team may also have resources available to help you manage stress.\n\nCalling and talking with friends and family can help you feel supported, which may help with stress, too. Laughter also has positive effects on our well-being and may help with stress reduction. It calms the body’s stress responses and may increase blood flow throughout your body, which can support your overall health. Watching a funny movie or a chat with an old friend can get you laughing and can lift your mood while supporting your overall well-being.\n<h2>Stay Hydrated to Sooth Dryness</h2>\nSome people undergoing cancer treatment experience dry mouth, dry skin, dry hair, dry eyes, and sensitivity or discomfort of skin. Staying hydrated is important, but it may be difficult to do during this time due to nausea and/or lack of appetite. When it’s difficult to drink water, try to mix it up. Add fresh fruit to your water to enhance the flavor, try drinking caffeine-free herbal teas, and eat fruits with high water content, such as watermelon. There are many products for dry mouth and dry eyes that can be soothing. There are also natural-based products for skin sensitivity and may be helpful for irritation from radiation.\n<h2>Consider Auricular Therapy</h2>\nAuricular therapy is a part of acupuncture that involves needling and/or applying acupressure seeds to the ear. The ear seeds are tiny, nonmetal balls that are applied to the ear at specific points to apply acupressure. They are held in place with surgical tape and are quick and painless to apply. When applied before cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, the ear seeds may help reduce treatment side effects, such as fatigue, in some people. They may also help the body de-stress by releasing endorphins, which are our “feel good” hormones. Ear seeds can be applied by themselves or used in conjunction with needling of the ear or whole body acupuncture.\n\nAt the <a href=\"https://yourhealth.promedica.org/acton/media/35511/promedica-natural-wellness-shop\">ProMedica Natural Wellness Shop</a>, auricular therapy is performed by a practitioner trained and licensed in acupuncture. Our licensed practitioner would conduct a consult with you to identify your goals and evaluate whether auricular therapy is right for you.\n\nLearn more about the basics of auricular therapy in this video:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/__uuAQ4xgLk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nEveryone’s cancer journey is different.

    "Title": "Your Ears May Be the Cause of Dizziness and Falling",
    "Content": "Several factors contribute to a person's risk for falls. This includes your environment, medications, strength and medical conditions. Yet one cause is often overlooked: the vestibular system.\n\nThe vestibular system includes the inner ear and brainstem. This system works with vision and proprioception (your awareness of your body's position). Together, they are the three main components of the human balance system.\n\nPeople with vestibular dysfunction usually experience dizziness. Dizziness is a broad term than can include imbalance, gait changes, floating sensations, and true spinning vertigo. Any of these feelings can increase a risk for falls. It can also affect quality of life. Twenty-percent of people have experienced vestibular problems and this rate increases with age.\n<h2>Positional Vertigo</h2>\nYour inner ear contains small particles called otoconia -- small \"ear rocks\" or \"crystals\". They help your body maintain its balance. Sometimes, otoconia can break off. The pieces float around inside your inner ear canals when you change your head's position. This can cause a short burst of spinning or tilting vertigo.\n\nThis is called benign paroxysmal position vertigo (BPPV). It's the most common type of positional vertigo, accounting for 40% of vertigo visits in primary care.\n\nTreating BPPV usually requires a series of specific positions that reposition the otoconia. The Epley is the most common repositioning maneuver.  It is most often performed by clinicians who have additional training in the vestibular system like physical therapists or ear, nose and throat specialists (ENTs).   During the Epley, the clinician will guide you through a specific series of head positions to move the otoconia back to a better location in the inner ear. The success rate of this intervention is 75-90%.\n<h2>Vestibular Hypofunction</h2>\nVestibular hypofunction is another type of vestibular dysfunction. It occurs when the balance system of the inner ear is not working properly. There are many causes of vestibular hypofunction but the most common are vestibular neuronitis or labrinthitis. These are usually caused from a viral or bacterial infection of your inner ear.  Symptoms can include dizziness, imbalance, visual changes, mental fatigue, hearing changes and walking difficulties. These problems can come on rapidly or slowly over time depending on the underlying problem.\n\nTreating vestibular hypofunction usually involves medications and vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Therapy focuses on exercises helping the vestibular system compensate to loss in vestibular function, balance, strength, and flexibility.  Sometimes, surgery is needed.\n<h2>Other Causes of Dizziness</h2>\nDizziness isn't always caused from your ears. Stress, dehydration, heart problems and vision issues can contribute. Central nervous system problems, such as stroke or a tumor, can also be a cause.\n\nTalk with your healthcare provider if you have dizziness and concerns about falling. An examination and health history are essential to finding the cause and treatment.\n\n[row]\n[column md=\"3\" sm=\"3\" xs=\"12\"]\n<img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7834 size-medium\" src=\"https://pronewsnetwork.wpengine.com/media/Andy-Parsons-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n[/column]\n[column md=\"9\" sm=\"9\" xs=\"12\"]\n\n<em>Andy Parsons, DPT, is a board-certified orthopaedic specialist and is also certified in vestibular rehabilitation.

    "Title": "How to Prevent Kidney Stones in the Summer",
    "Content": "We’ve probably all heard of someone we know who was in terrible pain and found out it was because of a kidney stone blockage.\n\nAccording to <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/timothy-g-schuster-md-facs-urology\">Timothy Schuster, MD,</a> a urologist with ProMedica Physicians Genito-Urinary Surgeons, the prevalence of kidney stones is especially high in the summer months. “Kidney stones are painful, common and treatable,” says Dr. Schuster. “There is such thing as the ‘stone belt’ where kidney stones are more common the closer people live to the equator. In our region, we see a much higher incidence of kidney stones in the warmer months.”\n<h2>What are kidney stones?</h2>\n“Kidney stones are hardened mineral deposits that form in the kidneys,” says Dr. Schuster. “It’s not the stone itself that causes pain but the fact that when a stone becomes lodged in the ureter, it can block the flow of urine which causes pressure to build up and cause severe pain.”\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, one in 10 people develop kidney stones during their lifetime. Kidney stones are most prevalent in people aged 30 to 45.\n<h2>What are the best methods of prevention?</h2>\n<strong>Drink plenty of water.</strong> Dr. Schuster recommends drinking enough water to pass two and a half liters of urine a day, which is roughly eight standard 8-ounce cups. “The biggest risk factor for kidney stones is dehydration which is why they are more common in the summer months. People need to drink more water when it’s warm and they are sweating.”\n\nWhile he recommends the ideal beverage is plain water, he suggests adding some natural citrus to your water to help block stone formation.\n\n<strong>Eat a diet rich in plants and vegetables.</strong> “Our Western diet consists of many high fat, high salt and high protein foods. The best foods for preventing kidney stones are fruits and vegetables,” says Dr. Schuster.\n<h2>What are the symptoms and when should you seek treatment?</h2>\nThe most common symptom is pain in the back and side and blood in the urine. “It can be intense and yes, I’ve had female patients describe it as being worse than childbirth. Many patients have mild to moderate pain and nausea.”\n\nDr. Schuster recommends that you notify your regular physician if you have consistent or sharp pain in your back or side. With severe pain or blood in the urine, you should to seek immediate, emergency medical attention.\n<h2>What are the biggest misconceptions about kidney stones?</h2>\n<strong>Avoiding calcium </strong>– The most common stones are comprised of calcium and oxalate. “Since people hear ‘calcium,’ they think you should eliminate calcium in your diet, but the opposite is true – a diet low is calcium actually increases your chances of developing kidney stones,” says Dr. Schuster.\n\n<strong>Consuming cranberry juice </strong>– “While consuming cranberry juice has been shown to prevent urinary tract infections, there is no data that cranberry juice has any effect on kidney stones,” says Dr. Schuster.\n<h2>How do you treat kidney stones?</h2>\n“The treatment depends on the size and type of stone,” says Dr. Schuster. “Our providers have the skill and experience to use the most advanced treatments available to address even the most difficult kidney stones.”\n\nThese are the most common treatments:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Laser Lithotripsy:</strong> uses a fiber passed through an instrument to deliver a laser beam to break up the kidney stone.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL):</strong> uses highly focused impulses projected from outside the body to pulverize kidney stones anywhere in the urinary system. This technique usually reduces the stone to sand-like granules that can be passed in the patient’s urine. Large stones may require several ESWL treatments. The procedure takes less than an hour and is done on an outpatient basis.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL): </strong>used for large stone (more than 2 cm). A tube is placed directly into the kidney through the back and then the stones are broken up and removed through the tube.</li>\n</ul>\nDr. Schuster explains that there are some people who are genetically predisposed to kidney stones, but the majority of people can prevent them by watching their fluid intake. “My biggest piece of advice is for people to be vigilant with their water consumption. It’s that easy and so important.”",

From mowing the grass, to bicycling, or going to the zoo with family, pain shouldn’t hold you back in your daily activities.\n\nAccording to Amy Breidenbach, manager, <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/pages/medical-services/pain-management/default.aspx\">ProMedica Pain Management,</a> pain isn’t just physically debilitating; but it can be mentally taxing, too.\n\n“When someone suffers from pain, they often say they just want their life back,” says Breidenbach. “When you can’t do your normal, daily activities, you feel a sense of loss, and depression goes along with it. Sometimes people who suffer from chronic pain feel like they are not good enough anymore.”\n\nBreidenbach advises people to discuss their pain with their primary care physician and to ask about being referred to a provider who specializes in treating pain. “Don’t be silent about your pain, and don’t feel discouraged and think there is nothing that can be done, because a pain management specialist can work with you to identify the source of the problem.”\n\nBreidenbach also stresses that not all pain is caused by the same problem, and what works for one person may not work for another. Nerve injuries, herniated discs, arthritis and migraines are just some potential causes of chronic pain. That’s why individualized treatment is so important.\n\n“Our pain management specialists at ProMedica are trained to assess patients and pinpoint where a person’s pain is coming from before creating an individualized treatment plan,” Breidenbach explains.\n\nSome people might be afraid to seek help for pain because they do not want to use narcotics or have surgery, but that’s a misconception about pain management. There are other pain relief options available, including procedures such as epidural steroid injections, nerve blocks, radiofrequency ablations, and more. Some of these procedures may result in a year or two of pain relief. The goal is to make pain manageable and tolerable. The pain may not go away completely, but it may be managed to a point where people can get their life back.\n\n“Don’t let pain stop you from doing the things you love. If you can no longer do daily activities, such as standing to do the dishes, vacuuming, sitting or standing for long periods of time, or being unable to sleep through the night due to the pain, it’s time to talk to your doctor or make an appointment with a pain management specialist to get you back to living your life to the fullest,” says Breidenbach.",

    "Title": "5 Ways to Take Control of Metabolic Syndrome",
    "Content": "What does it mean when your doctor says you have metabolic syndrome? What’s causing this mysterious syndrome? Can you change it? The good news is that yes, there are some factors of metabolic syndrome that are within your control.\n\nFirst, let’s learn about what it is.\n<h2>What is metabolic syndrome?</h2>\nMetabolic syndrome is a “collection” of abnormalities that includes obesity, insulin resistance, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. You are probably familiar with most of these terms, but may not know what insulin resistance means.\n\nInsulin is a hormone that is produced by our pancreas. It controls our blood sugar levels. Insulin’s job is to pull sugar and carbohydrates from our blood stream and put it into our cells where we can use it for energy. Insulin resistance means that your cells are resisting the signal from the insulin that says that the energy needs to go into your cells.\n\nIn response to this resistance, your body makes more insulin. Unfortunately, a person can only produce so much insulin in their lifetime. Consistently overproducing insulin means that at some point, your body will say “no thank you!” and stop producing so much insulin. This drop in insulin production means that your body will have higher blood sugars because the insulin isn’t there to move energy from your blood stream into your cells.\n<h2>How can I treat it?</h2>\nNow that you know the basic criteria for metabolic syndrome and what insulin resistance is, what’s next? There are several ways to help control and improve metabolic syndrome symptoms. Here are some lifestyle changes that can help you get back on track.\n<h3>1. Manage your weight.</h3>\nWhen it comes to weight loss, I challenge you not to lean on fad diets and short-term solutions. Why? Because if you want to decrease your risk of metabolic syndrome and improve your health, we need to think about long-term solutions.\n\nI am pretty sure that any of us could easily come up with some ideas of how we could improve our weight. Here are some of my ideas:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Eliminate one sugary drink a day (think pop, juice, energy drinks and sugared up coffee drinks).</li>\n \t<li>Eliminate one sweet treat a week.</li>\n \t<li>Replace your snack of chips with a piece of fresh fruit.</li>\n \t<li>Drink half of your body weight in ounces of water daily.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>2. Stop smoking.</h3>\nThis is a tricky one for many people. As anyone who smokes knows, quitting smoking is HARD! But the results are so extremely worth it. And there are resources to help. You can call the Michigan or Ohio Quit Lines for help at 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669).\n<h3>3. Monitor your blood pressure.</h3>\nIf your blood pressure is routinely over 140/90, talk with your doctor about medication management. Elevated blood pressure can be a significant health risk. We often think of high blood pressure in relation to decreasing sodium intake, but in reality there are a lot of things that can positively affect blood pressure. This includes weight management, more physical activity, improved stress management, and healthier food choices, including low sodium options.\n<h3>4. Monitor cholesterol levels.</h3>\nMany physicians monitor lab work yearly. Keeping track of trends with these numbers will help you assess what needs to change. Several factors effect these numbers including many of the items we have already discussed, such as weight management and physical activity. It’s important to become familiar with what each of the numbers mean and what level your doctor would like for you to achieve.\n<h3>5. Enjoy physical activity.</h3>\nMovement varies from person to person. There is no ONE right way to be more physically active. Here are some suggestions.\n<ul>\n \t<li>Take the dog for a walk.</li>\n \t<li>Play outside with the kids.</li>\n \t<li>Garden or participate in a community garden if you don’t have one in your yard.</li>\n \t<li>Use online videos as at-home exercise classes.</li>\n \t<li>Jump rope.</li>\n \t<li>Walk up and down the stairs in your house.</li>\n \t<li>Start a walking club with your neighbors.</li>\n</ul>\nWhatever you do, try not to be intimidated by doing it all. Small, livable changes can add up to HUGE results. The best version of you is waiting!\n\n<em>Jennifer Gilliland is an outpatient dietitian with ProMedica and a professional clinical counselor.

    "Title": "What to Do When You Spot an Eye Stye",
    "Content": "<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fJnb-c1nMAY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe>\n\nIt's happened to everyone at one time or another: You wake up with a sore bump around your eyelid. What do you do? <a href=\"https://www.promedica.org/provider/michelle-ariss-md-pediatric-ophthalmology\">Michelle Ariss, MD,</a> ProMedica Physicians Eye Care, talked with ProMedica Health Correspondent Chrys Peterson about eye styes and blepharitis. Here's why it happens, how to prevent it and how to treat it.\n<h3>Chris Peterson: What is blepharitis?</h3>\n<strong>Dr. Ariss:</strong> Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margin. Sometimes you don't really know it's there unless your eyelid is red and inflamed. Styes and bumps on the lid are kind of all in the same family.\n<h3>They can be really painful. Can they be dangerous to your eyesight?</h3>\nNot necessarily, but you can have an infection with it. Those are the ones that we worry about. It's something called cellulitis of the eyelid, which can stem from some, but not all, styes. So we tell parents to look out if anything is getting worse to let us know. But sometimes little bumps on the eyelid can linger.\n<h3>What can I do if I wake up in the morning and see that I have this bump?</h3>\nWe recommend warm compresses first and foremost. Our eyelid has many oil glands in it, and these bumps are clogged oil glands. What happens is instead of having an oil consistency that we want from the glands, it's more of a buttery consistency. We want that butter to get back to oil so it gets out of those glands. So as soon as you feel a little bit of discomfort on the eyelid, maybe something coming on, we recommend warm compresses.\n<h3>If it doesn't go away over time, it is important to see a doctor?</h3>\nYes, it's not a bad idea at all to go in and see your eye doctor. Sometimes we can recommend ointments. In some cases that are chronic, if a patient wants it removed we can actually surgically drain them. In children, unfortunately, it requires that we put them to sleep. But adults have them as well and if it's chronic and lingering and frustrating, those can be drained in the office setting while a patient is awake.\n<h3>Does blepharitis lead to a stye or are they two totally different things?</h3>\nIt can, yes. Sometimes you can just get the clogged gland by itself. But blepharitis, if you think of dandruff, it's kind of the same concept in your lashes. You get debris in the lashes. We see it a lot with the microscope but we don't see it obviously with the naked eye, unless you have a lot of scaled skin or things like that along the lid margin. What I always recommend: Shampoo your hair, scrub your lashes, especially women with eyeliner. I sometimes use a Q-tip to really get in there to try to scrub that line a little bit because all those things can build up and cause inflammation of the eyelid margin.\n<h3>Can makeup make it worse?</h3>\nYes, the problem with women, is that all our products say avoid the eye area. So if you're trying to wash your face, but then you're avoiding the eye area, how do you really get it clean? Pre-soaked lid scrubs can help, or eye makeup remover. Like I said, I sometimes will use a little Q-tip after I'm done washing my face. An easy one, like I said is to shampoo your hair and scrub your lashes, things like that to try to keep that lid margin clean. And sometimes, no matter what we do, we still get a bump here and there and you just have to use that warm compress.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"></p>",

    "Title": "It Is Time to Seek Help for Your Joint Pain?",
    "Content": "Many different conditions can lead to joint pain, including osteoarthritis, strains, sprains, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout. Joint pain is extremely common. In a national survey, about one-third of adults reported having joint pain within the past 30 days. Joint pain can affect any part of your body and can range from mildly irritating to debilitating. Joint pain may go away after a few weeks (acute), or last for several weeks or months (chronic). Even short-term pain and swelling in the joints can affect your quality of life.\n<h3>Managing Your Care At Home</h3>\nJoint pain is not usually an emergency, and most cases of mild joint pain can successfully be managed at home. When caring for joint pain at home you can follow these simple guidelines:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Avoid activities that cause or worsen your pain.</li>\n \t<li>Apply ice to your painful joint for 15-20 minutes a few times a day.</li>\n \t<li>Apply a heating pad, soak in a warm tub, or take a warm shower to relax muscles and increase circulation.</li>\n \t<li>Try an over the counter (OTC) pain reliever such as Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), Naproxen (Alieve) or Tylenol. Short-term use of these medications is appropriate, but prolonged use can lead to complications and side effects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Potential Treatment Plans</h3>\nWhen joint pain does not respond to remedies and treatments, you need to seek further help from a qualified physician to assess your pain and decreased function. A physical exam and further imaging of your joint, if necessary, can help with diagnosis and treatment. After evaluation, your physician will set up an appropriate plan for treatment, which may include:\n<h4>Change in lifestyle:</h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Utilize good posture.</li>\n \t<li>Keep your joints moving with appropriate activities (daily stretches and strengthening).</li>\n \t<li>Know your limits.</li>\n \t<li>Lose weight (being overweight can lead to increased pressure on joints and worsen osteoarthritis).</li>\n \t<li>Quit smoking (smoking causes stress on connective tissue and delays healing)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Exercise:</h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Choose the right kind of activities, including activities that build muscle around your joints but do not damage them. An exercise program and these treatments can be explained and demonstrated to you by a physical therapist.</li>\n \t<li>What to avoid: high impact activities, repeat movements, jumping and running</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Injections:</h4>\n<ul>\n \t<li>A joint injection can be given to help with other mentioned treatments.The injection may decrease inflammation and help with pain. Injections can be corticosteroid, or hyaluronic acid injections.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pain and Emotional Well-being</h3>\nIt is no surprise that arthritis pain has a negative effect on your mood. If everyday activities make you hurt, you are bound to feel discouraged.  When normal feelings escalate to create a constant refrain of fearful, hopeless thoughts, your pain can actually get worse and harder to manage. In order to help with these feelings, light medications or even counseling can be considered as part of your treatment plan.\n\nWhatever your condition, it will be easier to stay ahead of your pain if you:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Educate yourself about your condition, including what type of arthritis you have and whether any of your joints that are already damaged.</li>\n \t<li>Speak with your doctor, friends, and family in managing your pain.</li>\n \t<li>Tell your doctor if your pain changes or if you have any questions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Things to Avoid</h3>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Overtreatment.</strong> Talk with your doctor if you find yourself using over-the-counter pain relievers regularly.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Under treatment. </strong>Do not try to ignore severe and prolonged arthritis pain. You might have joint inflammation or damage requiring daily medication.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Focusing only on pain. </strong>Depression is more common in people with arthritis. Doctors have found that treating depression with antidepressants and other therapies reduces not only depression symptoms but also arthritis pain.</li>\n</ul>\nAlthough mild, short-term pain is common, severe or debilitating pain is never normal. This requires further evaluation and treatment by a physician who specializes in joint pain treatment.  A thorough evaluation by your physician can help you go through all options available for treatment. Most options that are available are considered conservative and can significantly improve pain and function.\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">[row]\n[column md=\"2\" sm=\"2\" xs=\"12\"]\n<a href=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Szepiela.jpg\"><img class=\"img-responsive alignnone wp-image-7555 size-medium\" src=\"https://promedica2020.wpengine.com/media/Szepiela-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></a>\n[/column]\n[column md=\"10\" sm=\"10\" xs=\"12\"]</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><em>Dr. Szepiela is board certified in physical medicine and rehabilitation, sports medicine and has a specialized interest in spinal intervention.
